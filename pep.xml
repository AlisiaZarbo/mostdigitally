	<p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</p>
	<p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>
	<p><said who="#MrsBennet" toWhom="MrBennet" aloud="true">"<rs type="person" key="MrBennet">My dear</rs> <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>,"</said> said <rs type="person" key="MrsBennet">his lady</rs> to him one day, <said who="#MrsBennet" toWhom="MrBennet" aloud="true">"have you heard that <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> is let at last?"</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrBennet" toWhom="MrsBennet" aloud="false"><persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> replied that he had not.</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrsBennet" toWhom="MrBennet" aloud="true">"But it is,"</said> returned she; <said who="#MrsBennet" toWhom="MrBennet" aloud="true">"for <persName key="MrsLong"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Long</surname></persName> has just been here, and she told me all about it."</said></p>
	<p><persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> made no answer.</p>
	<p><said who="#MrsBennet" toWhom="MrBennet" aloud="true">"Do you not want to know who has taken it?"</said> cried <rs type="person" key="MrsBennet">his wife</rs> impatiently.</p>
	<p><said who="#MrBennet" toWhom="MrsBennet" aloud="true">"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."</said></p>
	<p>This was invitation enough.</p>
	<p><said who="#MrsBennet" toWhom="MrBennet" aloud="true">"Why, <rs type="person" key="MrBennet">my dear</rs>, you must know, <persName key="MrsLong"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Long</surname></persName> says that <placeName>Netherfield</placeName> is taken by a young man of large fortune from the <placeName><offset>north of</offset> <country>England</country></placeName>; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with <persName><addName>Mr.</addName><surname>Morris</surname></persName> immediately; that he is to take possession before <persName><surname>Michaelmas</surname></persName>, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrBennet" toWhom="MrsBennet" aloud="true">"What is his name?"</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrsBennet" toWhom="MrBennet" aloud="true">"<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>."</said></p>
	<p><said>"Is he married or single?"</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrsBennet" toWhom="MrBennet" aloud="true">"Oh! Single, <rs type="person" key="MrBennet">my dear</rs>, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrBennet" toWhom="MrsBennet" aloud="true">"How so? How can it affect them?"</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrsBennet" toWhom="MrBennet" aloud="true">"<rs type="person" key="MrBennet">My dear</rs> <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>,"</said> replied <rs type="person" key="MrsBennet">his wife</rs>, <said who="#MrsBennet" toWhom="MrBennet" aloud="true">"how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrBennet" toWhom="MrsBennet" aloud="true">"Is that his design in settling here?"</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrsBennet" toWhom="MrBennet" aloud="true">"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrBennet" toWhom="MrsBennet" aloud="true">"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>may like you the best of the party."</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrsBennet" toWhom="MrBennet" aloud="true">"<rs type="person" key="MrBennet">My dear</rs>, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrBennet" toWhom="MrsBennet" aloud="true">"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrsBennet" toWhom="MrBennet" aloud="true">"But, <rs type="person" key="MrBennet">my dear</rs>, you must indeed go and see <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>  when he comes into the neighbourhood."</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrBennet" toWhom="MrsBennet" aloud="true">"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrsBennet" toWhom="MrBennet" aloud="true">"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. <persName><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName> and <persName key="LadyLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not."</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrBennet" toWhom="MrsBennet" aloud="true">"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>  will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>."</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrsBennet" toWhom="MrBennet" aloud="true">"I desire you will do no such thing. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName> is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, nor half so good-humoured as <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>. But you are always giving her the preference."</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrBennet" toWhom="MrsBennet" aloud="true">"They have none of them much to recommend them,"</said> replied he; <said who="#MrBennet" toWhom="MrsBennet" aloud="true">"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName> has something more of quickness than her sisters."</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrsBennet" toWhom="MrBennet" aloud="true">"<persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."</said></p>
	<p><said who="#MrBennet" toWhom="MrsBennet" aloud="true">"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least."</said></p>
	<p><persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make <rs type="person" key="MrsBennet">his wife</rs> understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="2">	
   
   	<head>Chapter 2</head>

	<p><persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was among the earliest of those who waited on <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> . He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.</p><p> It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:</p>
	<p>"I hope <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> will like it, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>."</p>
	<p>"We are not in a way to know what <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> likes," said <rs type="person" key="MrsBennet">her mother</rs> resentfully, "since we are not to visit."</p>
	<p>"But you forget, <rs type="person" key="MrsBennet">mamma</rs>," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that <persName key="MrsLong"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Long</surname></persName>  promised to introduce him."</p>
	<p>"I do not believe <persName key="MrsLong"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Long</surname></persName>  will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her."</p>
	<p>"No more have I," said <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."</p>
	<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName> Mrs.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.</p>
	<p>"Don't keep coughing so, <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, for Heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces."</p>
	<p>"<persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill."</p>
	<p>"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> fretfully. "When is your next ball to be, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>?"</p>
	<p>"To-morrow fortnight."</p>
	<p>"Aye, so it is," cried <rs type="person" key="MrsBennet">her mother</rs>, "and <persName key="MrsLong"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Long</surname></persName>  does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself."</p>
	<p>"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>  to her."</p>
	<p>"Impossible, <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?"</p>
	<p>"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if we do not venture somebody else will; and after all, <persName key="MrsLong"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Long</surname></persName>  and her daughters must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself."</p>
	<p>The girls stared at their father. <persName><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> said only, "Nonsense, nonsense!"</p>
	<p>"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he. "Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you there. What say you, <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName>? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts."</p>
	<p><persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.</p>
	<p>"While <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> ."</p>
	<p>"I am sick of <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> ," cried <rs type="person" key="MrsBennet">his wife</rs>.</p>
	<p>"I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that before? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now."</p>
	<p>The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>  perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.</p>
	<p>"How good it was in you, my dear <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>! But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now."</p>
	<p>"Now, <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, you may cough as much as you choose," said <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of <rs type="person" key="MrsBennet">his wife</rs>.</p>
	<p>"What an excellent father you have, girls!" said she, when the door was shut. "I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do anything. <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>  will dance with you at the next ball."</p>
	<p>"Oh!" said <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I am the youngest, I'm the tallest."</p>
	<p>The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.</p>

    <head>Chapter 3</head>
	<p>Not all that <persName><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>. They attacked him in various ways---with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, <persName key="LadyLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>. Her report was highly favourable. <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName> had been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s heart were entertained.</p>
	<p>"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>," said <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>  to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."</p>
	<p>In a few days <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> returned <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.</p>
	<p>An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>  planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>  was quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> as he ought to be. <persName key="LadyLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>---his five </p>
	<p>sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether---<persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.</p>
	<p><persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, <persName key="MrHurst"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName>, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName>  could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.</p>
	<p><persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> danced only once with <persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> and once with <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent against him was <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> , whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.</p>
	<p>"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance."</p>
	<p>"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with."</p>
	<p>"I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, "for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty."</p>
	<p>"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.</p>
	<p>"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you."</p>
	<p>"Which do you mean?" and turning round he looked for a moment at <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own</p>
	<p>and coldly said: "She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting</p>
	<p>your time with me."</p>
	<p><persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> followed his advice. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> walked off; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.</p>
	<p>The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>  had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> party. <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was as much gratified by this as <rs type="person" key="MrsBennet">her mother</rs> could be, though in a quieter way. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> felt<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s pleasure. <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> had heard herself mentioned to <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and <persName key="CatherineBennet"><forename>Catherine</forename></persName> and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> still up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the events of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that <rs type="person" key="MrsBennet">his wife</rs>'s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he </p>
	<p>soon found out that he had a different story to hear.</p>
	<p>"Oh! my dear <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she looked; and <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice! Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> as she was going down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with  <persName key="MaryKing"><addName>Miss</addName><surname>King</surname></persName>, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> again, and the two sixth with <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, and the _Boulanger_--"</p>
	<p>"If he had had any compassion for me," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of his partners. O that he had sprained his ankle in the first place!"</p>
	<p>"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon <persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName>'s gown---"</p>
	<p>Here she was interrupted again. <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> protested against any description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>.</p>
	<p>"But I can assure you," she added, "that <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName> does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man."</p>

    <head>Chapter 4</head>
	<p>When <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> before, expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him.</p>
	<p>"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"</p>
	<p>"He is also handsome," replied <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete."</p>
	<p>"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such a compliment."</p>
	<p>"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person."</p>
	<p>"Dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>!"</p>
	<p>"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life."</p>
	<p>"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I think."</p>
	<p>"I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough---one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design---to take the good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad---belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters, too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his."</p>
	<p>"Certainly not---at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> is to live with her brother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of  <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.</p>
	<p><persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>, and leave the next generation to purchase.</p>
	<p>His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he was now only established as a tenant, <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was by no means unwilling to preside at his table---nor was <persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName>, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> House. He did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour---was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.</p>
	<p>Between him and <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character.<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was endeared to <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard,<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was the superior.<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was by no means deficient, but <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was continually giving offense.</p>
	<p>The manner in which they spoke of the <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName> assembly was sufficiently characteristic.<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.</p>
	<p><persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> and her sister allowed it to be so---but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose.</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="5">	
    <head>Chapter 5</head>
	<p>Within a short walk of <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename><surname>Lucas</surname></persName> had been formerly in trade in <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.</p>
	<p><persName key="LadyLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> . They had several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s intimate friend.</p>
	<p>That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> to hear and to communicate.</p>
	<p>"_You_ began the evening well, <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> ," said <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> with civil self-command to <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>. "_You_ were <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s first choice."</p>
	<p>"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better."</p>
	<p>"Oh! you mean<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be sure that did seem as if he admired her---indeed I rather believe he _did_--I heard something about it---but I hardly know what---something about <persName key="MrRobinson"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Robinson</surname></persName>."</p>
	<p>"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and <persName key="MrRobinson"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Robinson</surname></persName>; did not I mention it to you? <persName key="MrRobinson"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Robinson</surname></persName>'s asking him how he liked our <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName> assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'"</p>
	<p>"Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed---that does seem as if---but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know."</p>
	<p>"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Eliza</forename></persName>," said <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> . "<persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?--poor <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Eliza</forename></persName>!--to be only just tolerable."</p>
	<p>"I beg you would not put it into <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>'s head to be vexed by his ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. <persName key="MrsLong"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Long</surname></persName>  told me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips."</p>
	<p>"Are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>. "I certainly saw <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> speaking to her."</p>
	<p>"Aye---because she asked him at last how he liked <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>, and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to."</p>
	<p>"<persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> told me," said<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, "that he never speaks much, unless among his intimate acquaintances. With them he is remarkably agreeable."</p>
	<p>"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to <persName key="MrsLong"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Long</surname></persName> . But I can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that <persName key="MrsLong"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Long</surname></persName>  does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."</p>
	<p>"I do not mind his not talking to <persName key="MrsLong"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Long</surname></persName> ," said <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>, "but I wish he had danced with <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Eliza</forename></persName>."</p>
	<p>"Another time, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>," said <rs type="person" key="MrsBennet">her mother</rs>, "I would not dance with him, if I were you."</p>
	<p>"I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you never to dance with him."</p>
	<p>"His pride," said <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>, "does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a right to be proud."</p>
	<p>"That is very true," replied <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "and I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine."</p>
	<p>"Pride," observed <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName>, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."</p>
	<p>"If I were as rich as <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>," cried a young Lucas, who came with his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day."</p>
	<p>"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> ; "and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly."</p>
	<p>The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.</p>

    <head>Chapter 6</head>
	<p>The ladies of <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> soon waited on those of <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>. The visit was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of <persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> and <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>; and though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest. By<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure, but <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It was generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the </p>
	<p>world in general, since <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>.</p>
	<p>"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> , "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely---a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show more affection than she feels.<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."</p>
	<p>"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too."</p>
	<p>"Remember, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Eliza</forename></persName>, that he does not know<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s disposition as you do."</p>
	<p>"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out."</p>
	<p>"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> and <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses."</p>
	<p>"Your plan is a good one," replied <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character."</p>
	<p>"Not as you represent it. Had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together---and four evenings may do a great deal."</p>
	<p>"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."</p>
	<p>"Well," said <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> , "I wish <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life."</p>
	<p>"You make me laugh, <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> ; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."</p>
	<p>Occupied in observing <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s attentions to her sister, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and </p>
	<p>who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.</p>
	<p>He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename><surname>Lucas</surname></persName>'s, where a large party were assembled.</p>
	<p>"What does <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> mean," said she to <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> , "by listening to my conversation with <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName>?"</p>
	<p>"That is a question which <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> only can answer."</p>
	<p>"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."</p>
	<p>On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> defied her friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> to do it, she turned to him and said:</p>
	<p>"Did you not think, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> to give us a ball at <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>?"</p>
	<p>"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic."</p>
	<p>"You are severe on us."</p>
	<p>"It will be her turn soon to be teased," said <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>. "I am going to open the instrument, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Eliza</forename></persName>, and you know what follows."</p>
	<p>"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers." On <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>'s persevering, however, she added, "Very well, if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing at <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, "There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with: 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge'; and I shall keep mine to swell my song."</p>
	<p>Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName>, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.</p>
	<p><persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName>, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.</p>
	<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename><surname>Lucas</surname></persName> was his neighbour, till <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName>thus began:</p>
	<p>"What a charming amusement for young people this is, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>! There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society."</p>
	<p>"Certainly, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance."</p>
	<p><persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName>only smiled. "Your friend performs delightfully," he continued after a pause, on seeing<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> join the group; "and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>."</p>
	<p>"You saw me dance at <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>, I believe, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>."</p>
	<p>"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do you often dance at St. James's?"</p>
	<p>"Never, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>."</p>
	<p>"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"</p>
	<p>"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."</p>
	<p>"You have a house in town, I conclude?"</p>
	<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> bowed.</p>
	<p>"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself---for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> would agree with <persName key="LadyLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>."</p>
	<p>He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her:</p>
	<p>"My dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName>Miss</addName><forename>Eliza</forename></persName>, why are you not dancing? <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you." And, taking her hand, he would have given it to <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> William:</p>
	<p>"Indeed, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."</p>
	<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was determined; nor did <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName>at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.</p>
	<p>"You excel so much in the dance, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName>Miss</addName><forename>Eliza</forename></persName>, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half-hour."</p>
	<p>"<persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> is all politeness," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, smiling.</p>
	<p>"He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName>Miss</addName><forename>Eliza</forename></persName>, we cannot wonder at his complaisance---for who would object to such a partner?"</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>:</p>
	<p>"I can guess the subject of your reverie."</p>
	<p>"I should imagine not."</p>
	<p>"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner---in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise---the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!"</p>
	<p>"You conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."</p>
	<p><persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> replied with great intrepidity:</p>
	<p>"<persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName>Miss</addName> <forename>Elizabeth</forename> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>."</p>
	<p>"<persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName>Miss</addName><forename>Elizabeth</forename> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>!" repeated <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>. "I am all astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you joy?"</p>
	<p>"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy."</p>
	<p>"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> with you."</p>
	<p>He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.</p>

    <head>Chapter 7</head>
	<p><persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>, and had left her four thousand pounds.</p>
	<p>She had a sister married to a <persName key="MrPhillips"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> in a respectable line of trade.</p>
	<p>The village of <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> was only one mile from <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, <persName key="CatherineBennet"><forename>Catherine</forename></persName> and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName> was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName> was the headquarters.</p>
	<p>Their visits to <persName key="MrPhillips"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. <persName key="MrPhillips"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.</p>
	<p>After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> coolly observed:</p>
	<p>"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced."</p>
	<p><persName key="CatherineBennet"><forename>Catherine</forename></persName> was disconcerted, and made no answer; but <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>.</p>
	<p>"I am astonished, my dear," said <addName>Mrs.</addName>. Bennet, "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however."</p>
	<p>"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it."</p>
	<p>"Yes---but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."</p>
	<p>"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish."</p>
	<p>"My dear <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well---and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> looked very becoming the other night at <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> William's in his regimentals."</p>
	<p>"Mamma," cried <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, "my aunt says that <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in</p>
	<p>Clarke's library."</p>
	<p><addName>Mrs.</addName>. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>, and the servant waited for an answer. <addName>Mrs.</addName>. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,</p>
	<p>"Well,<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."</p>
	<p>"It is from <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>," said<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, and then read it aloud.</p>
	<p>"MY DEAR FRIEND,--</p>
	<p>"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with<persName key="LouisaHurst"><forename>Louisa</forename></persName> and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.---Yours ever,</p>
	<p>"<persName key="CarolineBingley"><forename>CAROLINE</forename><surname>BINGLEY</surname></persName>"</p>
	<p>"With the officers!" cried <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>. "I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that."</p>
	<p>"Dining out," said <addName>Mrs.</addName>. Bennet, "that is very unlucky."</p>
	<p>"Can I have the carriage?" said<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>.</p>
	<p>"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night."</p>
	<p>"That would be a good scheme," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home."</p>
	<p>"Oh! but the gentlemen will have <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s chaise to go to <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."</p>
	<p>"I had much rather go in the coach."</p>
	<p>"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are wanted in the farm, <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, are they not?"</p>
	<p>"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."</p>
	<p>"But if you have got them to-day," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "my mother's purpose will be answered."</p>
	<p>She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> certainly could not come back.</p>
	<p>"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said <addName>Mrs.</addName>. Bennet more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> brought the following note for <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>:</p>
	<p>"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing <addName>Mr.</addName> Jones---therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me---and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the matter with me.---Yours, etc."</p>
	<p>"Well, my dear," said <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, when <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had read the note aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness---if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, and under your orders."</p>
	<p>"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage."</p>
	<p>Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.</p>
	<p>"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there."</p>
	<p>"I shall be very fit to see<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>---which is all I want."</p>
	<p>"Is this a hint to me, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>," said her father, "to send for the horses?"</p>
	<p>"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner."</p>
	<p>"I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName>, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."</p>
	<p>"We will go as far as <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName> with you," said <persName key="CatherineBennet"><forename>Catherine</forename></persName>and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.</p>
	<p>"If we make haste," said <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, as they walked along, "perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes."</p>
	<p>In <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName> they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.</p>
	<p>She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to <persName key="MrHurst"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> and <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> said very little, and <persName key="MrHurst"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.</p>
	<p>Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was glad to be taken to her immediately; and<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> silently attended her.</p>
	<p>When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere.</p>
	<p>When the clock struck three, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so. <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> testified such concern in parting with her, that <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> for the present. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes.</p>
   </div>

    <head>Chapter 8</head>
	<p>At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s, she could not make a very favourable answer. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> when not immediately before them restored <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.</p>
	<p>Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from any but him. <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was engrossed by <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, her sister scarcely less so; and as for <persName key="MrHurst"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName>, by whom <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.</p>
	<p>When dinner was over, she returned directly to<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, and <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. <persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> thought the same, and added:</p>
	<p>"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really looked almost wild."</p>
	<p>"She did, indeed,<persName key="LouisaHurst"><forename>Louisa</forename></persName>. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!"</p>
	<p>"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office."</p>
	<p>"Your picture may be very exact,<persName key="LouisaHurst"><forename>Louisa</forename></persName>," said<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>; "but this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice."</p>
	<p>"_You_ observed it, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, I am sure," said <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>; "and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition."</p>
	<p>"Certainly not."</p>
	<p>"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum."</p>
	<p>"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>.</p>
	<p>"I am afraid, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>," observed <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes."</p>
	<p>"Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise." A short pause followed this speech, and <persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> began again:</p>
	<p>"I have a excessive regard for <persName key="JaneBennet"><addName>Miss></addName><forename>Jane</forename><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it."</p>
	<p>"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>."</p>
	<p>"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."</p>
	<p>"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.</p>
	<p>"If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside," cried<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable."</p>
	<p>"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy.</p>
	<p>To this speech<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.</p>
	<p>With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below, with a book. <persName key="MrHurst"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> looked at her with astonishment.</p>
	<p>"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular."</p>
	<p>"<persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName>Miss</addName><forename>Eliza</forename><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>," said <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, "despises cards. She is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else."</p>
	<p>"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; "I am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."</p>
	<p>"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>; "and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her others---all that his library afforded.</p>
	<p>"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever looked into."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.</p>
	<p>"I am astonished," said <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, "that my father should have left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>!"</p>
	<p>"It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations."</p>
	<p>"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books."</p>
	<p>"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these."</p>
	<p>"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place. <persName key="CharlesBingley"><forename>Charles</forename></persName>, when you build your house, I wish it may be half as delightful as <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>."</p>
	<p>"I wish it may."</p>
	<p>"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> for a kind of model. There is not a finer county in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> than <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName> ."</p>
	<p>"With all my heart; I will buy <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> itself if <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> will sell it."</p>
	<p>"I am talking of possibilities, <persName key="CharlesBingley"><forename>Charles</forename></persName>."</p>
	<p>"Upon my word,<persName key="CarolineBingley"><forename>Caroline</forename></persName>, I should think it more possible to get <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> by purchase than by imitation."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> and his eldest sister, to observe the game.</p>
	<p>"Is <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> much grown since the spring?" said <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>; "will she be as tall as I am?"</p>
	<p>"I think she will. She is now about Miss <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s height, or rather taller." </p>
	<p>"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite."</p>
	<p>"It is amazing to me," said<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are."</p>
	<p>"All young ladies accomplished! My dear <persName key="CharlesBingley"><forename>Charles</forename></persName>, what do you mean?"</p>
	<p>"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished."</p>
	<p>"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished."</p>
	<p>"Nor I, I am sure," said <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>.</p>
	<p>"Then," observed <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman."</p>
	<p>"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it." </p>
	<p>"Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to</p>
	<p>deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved."</p>
	<p>"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading."</p>
	<p>"I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any."</p>
	<p>"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?"</p>
	<p>"I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united."</p>
	<p><persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> and <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when <persName key="MrHurst"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> soon afterwards left the room.</p>
	<p>"<persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>," said <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."</p>
	<p>"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable."</p>
	<p><persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> urged <addName>Mr.</addName> Jones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that <addName>Mr.</addName> Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better.<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.</p>

    <head>Chapter 9</head>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>, desiring her mother to visit<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, and form her own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> soon after the family breakfast.</p>
	<p>Had she found <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> in any apparent danger, <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>. She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, on <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughter all attended her into the breakfast parlour.<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> met them with hopes that <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.</p>
	<p>"Indeed I have, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>," was her answer. "She is a great deal too ill to be moved. <addName>Mr.</addName> Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness."</p>
	<p>"Removed!" cried<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>. "It must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal."</p>
	<p>"You may depend upon it, Madam," said <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, with cold civility, "that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us."</p>
	<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was profuse in her acknowledgments.</p>
	<p>"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her. You have a sweet room here, <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease."</p>
	<p>"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I should resolve to quit <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."</p>
	<p>"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>.</p>
	<p>"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her.</p>
	<p>"Oh! yes---I understand you perfectly."</p>
	<p>"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful."</p>
	<p>"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."</p>
	<p>"<persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."</p>
	<p>"I did not know before," continued<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> immediately, "that you were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study."</p>
	<p>"Yes, but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have at least that advantage."</p>
	<p>"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society."</p>
	<p>"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever."</p>
	<p>"Yes, indeed," cried <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. "I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town."</p>
	<p>Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.</p>
	<p>"I cannot see that <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> has any great advantage over the country, for my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>?"</p>
	<p>"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."</p>
	<p>"Aye---that is because you have the right disposition. But that</p>
	<p>gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all."</p>
	<p>"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, blushing for her mother. "You quite mistook <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>. He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true."</p>
	<p>"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families."</p>
	<p>Nothing but concern for <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> could enable<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> to keep his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> with a very expressive smile. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  Lucas had been at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> since her coming away.</p>
	<p>"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName>is, <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So genteel and easy! He had always something to say to everybody. That is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter."</p>
	<p>"Did <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  dine with you?"</p>
	<p>"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For my part, <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, I always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  so very plain---but then she is our particular friend."</p>
	<p>"She seems a very pleasant young woman."</p>
	<p>"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. <persName key="LadyLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> herself has often said so, and envied me<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure,<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>---one does not often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."</p>
	<p>"And so ended his affection," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> impatiently. "There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"</p>
	<p>"I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love," said <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName>.</p>
	<p>"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."</p>
	<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> began repeating her thanks to <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> for his kindness to<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, with an apology for troubling him also with <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>. <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>.</p>
	<p><persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:</p>
	<p>"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill."</p>
	<p><persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> declared herself satisfied. "Oh! yes---it would be much better to wait till <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName> again. And when you have given your ball," she added, "I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> it will be quite a shame if he does not."</p>
	<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> and her daughters then departed, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> returned instantly to<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s witticisms on fine eyes.</p>

    <head>Chapter 10</head>
	<p>The day passed much as the day before had done. <persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> and <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> joined their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was writing, and <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. <persName key="MrHurst"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> and <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> were at piquet, and <persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> was observing their game.</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> and his companion. The perpetual commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in union with her opinion of each.</p>
	<p>"How delighted <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> will be to receive such a letter!"</p>
	<p>He made no answer.</p>
	<p>"You write uncommonly fast."</p>
	<p>"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly."</p>
	<p>"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!"</p>
	<p>"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours."</p>
	<p>"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."</p>
	<p>"I have already told her so once, by your desire."</p>
	<p>"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well."</p>
	<p>"Thank you---but I always mend my own."</p>
	<p>"How can you contrive to write so even?"</p>
	<p>He was silent.</p>
	<p>"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's."</p>
	<p>"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At present I have not room to do them justice."</p>
	<p>"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to her, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>?"</p>
	<p>"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine."</p>
	<p>"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill."</p>
	<p>"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy,<persName key="CarolineBingley"><forename>Caroline</forename></persName>," cried her brother, "because he does not write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?"</p>
	<p>"My style of writing is very different from yours."</p>
	<p>"Oh!" cried <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, "Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."</p>
	<p>"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them---by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."</p>
	<p>"Your humility, <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "must disarm reproof."</p>
	<p>"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast."</p>
	<p>"And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?"</p>
	<p>"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself---and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?"</p>
	<p>"Nay," cried<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies."</p>
	<p>"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, '<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not go---and at another word, might stay a month."</p>
	<p>"You have only proved by this," cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "that <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much more than he did himself."</p>
	<p>"I am exceedingly gratified," said<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could."</p>
	<p>"Would <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"</p>
	<p>"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> must speak for himself."</p>
	<p>"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety."</p>
	<p>"To yield readily---easily---to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you."</p>
	<p>"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either."</p>
	<p>"You appear to me, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"</p>
	<p>"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?"</p>
	<p>"By all means," cried<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure you, that if <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has nothing to do."</p>
	<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> smiled; but <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> thought she could perceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.</p>
	<p>"I see your design,<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>," said his friend. "You dislike an argument, and want to silence this."</p>
	<p>"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."</p>
	<p>"What you ask," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "is no sacrifice on my side; and <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> had much better finish his letter."</p>
	<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> took her advice, and did finish his letter.</p>
	<p>When that business was over, he applied to <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> for an indulgence of some music. <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.</p>
	<p><persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation.</p>
	<p>After playing some Italian songs, <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, drawing near <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, said to her:</p>
	<p>"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"</p>
	<p>She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.</p>
	<p>"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all---and now despise me if you dare."</p>
	<p>"Indeed I do not dare."</p>
	<p>Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.</p>
	<p><persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>.</p>
	<p>She often tried to provoke <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.</p>
	<p>"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do sure the younger girls of running after officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses."</p>
	<p>"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?"</p>
	<p>"Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>. Put them next to your great-uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines. As for your <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s picture, you must not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"</p>
	<p>"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied."</p>
	<p>At that moment they were met from another walk by <persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> herself.</p>
	<p>"I did not know that you intended to walk," said <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.</p>
	<p>"You used us abominably ill," answered <persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName>, "running away without telling us that you were coming out."</p>
	<p>Then taking the disengaged arm of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, she left <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> felt their rudeness, and immediately said:</p>
	<p>"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the avenue."</p>
	<p>But <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered:</p>
	<p>"No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye."</p>
	<p>She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.</p>

    <head>Chapter 11</head>
	<p>When the ladies removed after dinner, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.</p>
	<p>But when the gentlemen entered, <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was no longer the first object; <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; <persName key="MrHurst"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.</p>
	<p>When tea was over, <persName key="MrHurst"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table---but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> did not wish for cards; and <persName key="MrHurst"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> soon found even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. <persName key="MrHurst"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> took up a book; <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> did the same; and <persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName>, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet. </p>
	<p><persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s attention was quite as much engaged in watching <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library."</p>
	<p>No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:</p>
	<p>"By the bye, <persName key="CharlesBingley"><forename>Charles</forename></persName>, are you really serious in meditating a dance at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure."</p>
	<p>"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chooses, before it begins---but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my cards."</p>
	<p>"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day."</p>
	<p>"Much more rational, my dear<persName key="CarolineBingley"><forename>Caroline</forename></persName>, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball."</p>
	<p><persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, said:</p>
	<p>"<persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName>Miss</addName><forename>Eliza</forename><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere. "What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his meaning?"---and asked <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> whether she could at all understand him?</p>
	<p>"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it."</p>
	<p><persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, however, was incapable of disappointing <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.</p>
	<p>"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak. "You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire."</p>
	<p>"Oh! shocking!" cried <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>. "I never heard anything so abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?"</p>
	<p>"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>. "We can all plague and punish one another. Tease him---laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."</p>
	<p>"But upon my honour, I do not. I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that. Tease calmness of manner and presence of mind! No, no---feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> may hug himself."</p>
	<p>"<persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> is not to be laughed at!" cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>. "That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a laugh."</p>
	<p>"<persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>," said he, "has given me more credit than can be. The wisest and the best of men---nay, the wisest and best of their actions---may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke."</p>
	<p>"Certainly," replied <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>---"there are such people, but I hope I am not one of them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without."</p>
	<p>"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule."</p>
	<p>"Such as vanity and pride."</p>
	<p>"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride---where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>turned away to hide a smile.</p>
	<p>"Your examination of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> is over, I presume," said <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>; "and pray what is the result?"</p>
	<p>"I am perfectly convinced by it that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> has no defect. He owns it himself without disguise."</p>
	<p>"No," said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yielding---certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of other so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever."</p>
	<p>"_That_ is a failing indeed!" cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>. "Implacable resentment is a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I really cannot laugh at it. You are safe from me."</p>
	<p>"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil---a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."</p>
	<p>"And your defect is to hate everybody."</p>
	<p>"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is willfully to misunderstand them."</p>
	<p>"Do let us have a little music," cried <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, tired of a conversation in which she had no share. "Louisa, you will not mind my waking <persName key="MrHurst"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName>?"</p>
	<p>Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened; and Darcy, after a few moments' recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> too much attention.</p>

    <head>Chapter 12</head>
	<p>In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. But <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. Against staying longer, however, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was positively resolved---nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> to borrow <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their </p>
	<p>original design of leaving <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.</p>
	<p>The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>; and till the morrow their going was deferred. <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.</p>
	<p>The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her---that she was not enough recovered; but <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was firm where she felt herself to be right.</p>
	<p>To <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> it was welcome intelligence---<persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>had been at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> long enough. She attracted him more than he liked---and <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was uncivil to her, and more teasing than usual to himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.</p>
	<p> On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place. <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s civility to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  or <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.</p>
    <p>They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> would have caught cold again. But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>.</p>
	<p>They found <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName>, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to. <persName key="CatherineBennet"><forename>Catherine</forename></persName> and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> had information for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> was going to be married.</p>

	<p>"I hope, my dear," said <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."</p>
	<p>"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure, unless <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  Lucas should happen to call in---and I hope my dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home."</p>
	<p>"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger."</p>
	<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s eyes sparkled. "A gentleman and a stranger! It is <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>. But---good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, my love, ring the bell---I must speak to Hill this moment."</p>
	<p>"It is not <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>," said her husband; "it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life."</p>
	<p>This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.</p>
	<p>After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:</p>
	<p>"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."</p>
	<p>"Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it."</p>
	<p><persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.</p>
	<p>"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, "and nothing can clear <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> from the guilt of inheriting <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> . But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself."</p>
	<p>"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?"</p>
	<p>"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear."</p>
	<p>"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.</p>
	<p>"Dear <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>,--</p>
	<p>"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.---'There, <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>.'---My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename><nameLink>de</nameLink><surname>Bourgh</surname> </persName>, widow of <persName key="LewisdeBourgh"> <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>Lewis</forename><nameLink>de</nameLink><surname>Bourgh</surname> </persName>, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of  <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> . As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the </p>
	<p>blessing of peace in all families within in the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends---but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.---I remain, dear </p>
	<p><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,</p>
	<p>"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman," said <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, as he folded up the letter. "He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again."</p>
	<p>"There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him."</p>
	<p>"Though it is difficult," said<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.</p>
	<p>"He must be an oddity, I think," said she. "I cannot make him out.---There is something very pompous in his style.---And what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he would help it if he could.---Could he be a sensible man, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>?"</p>
	<p>"No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him."</p>
	<p>"In point of composition," said <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName>, "the letter does not seem defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed."</p>
	<p>To <persName key="CatherineBennet"><forename>Catherine</forename></persName> and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for their mother, <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.</p>
	<p><persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family. <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated before he complimented <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> on having so fine a family of daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.</p>
	<p>"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly."</p>
	<p>"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate."</p>
	<p>"Ah! <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with you, for such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed."</p>
	<p>"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted---"</p>
	<p>He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. They were not the only objects of <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing. But he was set right there by <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.</p>

    <head>Chapter 14</head>
	<p>During dinner, <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename><nameLink>de</nameLink><surname>Bourgh</surname> </persName>'s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> could not have chosen better. <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that "he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank---such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>. She had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but he had never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself---some shelves in the closet upstairs."</p>
	<p>"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, "and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>?"</p>
	<p>"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence."</p>
	<p>"I think you said she was a widow, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>? Has she any family?"</p>
	<p>"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property."</p>
	<p>"Ah!" said <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?"</p>
	<p>"She is a most charming young lady indeed. <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."</p>
	<p>"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court."</p>
	<p>"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornaments. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once observed to <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay."</p>
	<p>"You judge very properly," said <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?"</p>
	<p>"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible."</p>
	<p><persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, requiring no partner in his pleasure.</p>
	<p>By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> stared at him, and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some</p>
	<p>deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with:</p>
	<p>"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard; and if he does, <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> will hire him. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName> to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when <addName>Mr.</addName> Denny comes back from town."</p>
	<p><persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:</p>
	<p>"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin."</p>
	<p>Then turning to <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon. <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> and her daughters apologised most civilly for <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, and prepared for backgammon.</p>

    <head>Chapter 15</head>
	<p><persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"> <roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename><nameLink>de</nameLink><surname>Bourgh</surname> </persName> when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and </p>
	<p>humility.</p>
	<p>Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. This was his plan of amends---of atonement---for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.</p>
	<p>His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening she was his settled choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> he had fixed on. "As to her younger daughters, she could not take upon her to say---she could not positively answer---but she did not know of any prepossession; her eldest daughter, she must just mention---she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."</p>
	<p><persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> had only to change from <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>---and it was soon done---done while <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was stirring the fire. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, equally next to <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.</p>
	<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces.</p>
	<p><persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s intention of walking to <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName> was not forgotten; every sister except <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> agreed to go with her; and <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> was to attend them, at the request of <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> had followed him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his</p>
	<p>civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> to join his daughters in their walk; and <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.</p>
	<p>In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>. The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them.</p>
	<p>But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very <addName>Mr.</addName> Denny concerning whose return from <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot. <addName>Mr.</addName> Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the </p>
	<p>best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation---a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> and<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  on purpose to inquire after her. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour, one looked white, </p>
	<p>the other red. <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, after a few moments, touched his hat---a salutation which <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> just deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.</p>
	<p>In another minute, <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend. </p>
	<p><addName>Mr.</addName> Denny and <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> walked with the young ladies to the door of <addName>Mr.</addName> Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of <persName key="MrsPhillips"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>'s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation.</p>
	<p><persName key="MrsPhillips"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see <addName>Mr.</addName> Jones's shop-boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> by<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s introduction of him. She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. <persName key="MrsPhillips"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the </p>
	<p>other; of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that <addName>Mr.</addName> Denny had brought him from <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> appeared, <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, and give him an invitation also, if the family from <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and <persName key="MrsPhillips"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> repeated his </p>
	<p>apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.</p>
	<p>As they walked home, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> related to <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.</p>
	<p><persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> on his return highly gratified <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> by admiring <persName key="MrsPhillips"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>'s manners and politeness. He protested that, except <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.</p>

    <head>Chapter 16</head>
	<p>As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s scruples of leaving <addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.</p>
	<p>When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when <persName key="MrsPhillips"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor---when she had listened to the description of only one of <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>'s drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.</p>
	<p>In describing to her all the grandeur of <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in <persName key="MrsPhillips"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was</p>
	<p>resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however. The gentlemen did approach, and when <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> walked into the room, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as they were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.</p>
	<p><persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.</p>
	<p>With such rivals for the notice of the fair as <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> and the officers, <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in <addName>Mrs.</addName>. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.</p>
	<p>"I know little of the game at present," said he, "but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life---" <persName key="MrsPhillips"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.</p>
	<p><persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>. At first there seemed danger of <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> was therefore at leisure to talk to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told---the history of his acquaintance with <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>. She dared not even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> began the subject himself. He inquired how far <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> was from <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> had been staying there.</p>
	<p>"About a month," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName> , I understand."</p>
	<p>"Yes," replied <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>; "his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>could not but look surprised.</p>
	<p>"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>?"</p>
	<p>"As much as I ever wish to be," cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> very warmly. "I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable."</p>
	<p>"I have no right to give my opinion," said  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, "as to his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for me to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish---and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your own family."</p>
	<p>"Upon my word, I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>. He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone."</p>
	<p>"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen."</p>
	<p>"I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man."  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> only shook his head.</p>
	<p>"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer."</p>
	<p>"I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."</p>
	<p>"Oh! no---it is not for me to be driven away by <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go. We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.</p>
	<p><persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> began to speak on more general topics, <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.</p>
	<p>"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName> had procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude. I must have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible. The church ought to have been my profession---I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now."</p>
	<p>"Indeed!"</p>
	<p>"Yes---the late <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere."</p>
	<p>"Good heavens!" cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; "but how could that be? How could his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?"</p>
	<p>"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> chose to doubt it---or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence---in short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me."</p>
	<p>"This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced."</p>
	<p>"Some time or other he will be---but it shall not be by me. Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose him."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.</p>
	<p>"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive? What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"</p>
	<p>"A thorough, determined dislike of me---a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood---the sort of preference which was often given me."</p>
	<p>"I had not thought <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> so bad as this---though I have never liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this."</p>
	<p>After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, "I do remember his boasting one day, at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be dreadful."</p>
	<p>"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>; "I can hardly be just to him."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!" She could have added, "A young man, too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"---but she contented herself with, "and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!"</p>
	<p>"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the</p>
	<p>same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. My father began life in the profession which your uncle, <persName key="MrPhillips"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, appears to do so much credit to---but he gave up everything to be of use to the late <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> and devoted all his time to the care of the <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> property. He was most highly esteemed by <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, a most intimate, confidential friend. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence, and when, immediately before my father's death, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him, as of his affection to myself."</p>
	<p>"How strange!" cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>. "How abominable! I wonder that the very pride of this <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> has not made him just to you! If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest---for dishonesty I must call it."</p>
	<p>"It is wonderful," replied  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, "for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride."</p>
	<p>"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?"</p>
	<p>"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and filial pride---for he is very proud of what his father was---have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> House, is a powerful motive. He has also brotherly pride, which, with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers."</p>
	<p>"What sort of girl is <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>?"</p>
	<p>He shook his head. "I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother---very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, her home has been <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education."</p>
	<p>After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:</p>
	<p>"I am astonished at his intimacy with <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>! How can <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you know <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>?"</p>
	<p>"Not at all."</p>
	<p>"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> is."</p>
	<p>"Probably not; but <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> can please where he chooses. He does not want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable---allowing something for fortune and figure."</p>
	<p>The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table and <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> took his station between his cousin <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> and <persName key="MrsPhillips"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>. The usual inquiries as to his success was made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when <persName key="MrsPhillips"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would not make herself uneasy.</p>
	<p>"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"> <roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename><nameLink>de</nameLink><surname>Bourgh</surname> </persName>, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters."</p>
	<p><persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s attention was caught; and after observing <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> for a few moments, he asked <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.</p>
	<p>"<persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"> <roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename><nameLink>de</nameLink><surname>Bourgh</surname> </persName>," she replied, "has very lately given him a living. I hardly know how <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long."</p>
	<p>"You know of course that <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"> <roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename><nameLink>de</nameLink><surname>Bourgh</surname> </persName> and Lady Anne <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>."</p>
	<p>"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>'s connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday."</p>
	<p>"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."</p>
	<p>This information made <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> smile, as she thought of poor <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined for another.</p>
	<p>"<persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>," said she, "speaks highly both of <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."</p>
	<p>"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>; "I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that</p>
	<p>I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of <persName key="MrsPhillips"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>'s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> went away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> nor <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> were once silent. <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> in describing the civility of <addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="MrsPhillips"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more </p>
	<p>to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  House.</p>

	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>related to <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> the next day what had passed between <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> and herself. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> listened with astonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> could be so unworthy of <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>. The possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.</p>
	<p>"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side."</p>
	<p>"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? Do clear them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody."</p>
	<p>"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no."</p>
	<p>"I can much more easily believe <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s being imposed on, than that <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks."</p>
	<p>"It is difficult indeed---it is distressing. One does not know what to think."</p>
	<p>"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think."</p>
	<p>But <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> could think with certainty on only one point---that <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.</p>
	<p>The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> as much as possible, saying not much to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s civilities.</p>
	<p>The prospect of the <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> himself, instead of a ceremonious card. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of her brother; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s look and behavior. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, meant to dance half the evening with <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.</p>
	<p>"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough---I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody."</p>
	<p>Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"> <roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename><nameLink>de</nameLink><surname>Bourgh</surname> </persName>, by venturing to dance.</p>
	<p>"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, for the two first dances especially, a preference which I trust my cousin <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being engaged by <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> for those very dances; and to have <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help for it, however. <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their </p>
	<p>marriage was extremely agreeable to her. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.</p>
	<p>If there had not been a <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName> once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after---the very shoe-roses for <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> were got by proxy. Even <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>.</p>

    <head>Chapter 18</head>
	<p>Till <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> entered the drawing-room at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>, and looked in vain for <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> eagerly applied, and who told them that  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, "I do not imagine his business would have </p>
	<p>called him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here."</p>
	<p>This part of his intelligence, though unheard by <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, was caught by <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, and, as it assured her that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was not less answerable for  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, whose blind partiality provoked her.</p>
	<p>But <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification. <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstasy.</p>
	<p>She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances were over, she returned to <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  Lucas,</p>
	<p>and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  tried to console her:</p>
	<p>"I dare say you will find him very agreeable."</p>
	<p>"Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an evil."</p>
	<p>When the dancing recommenced, however, and <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> approached to claim her hand, <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, and reading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with:--"It is your turn to say something now, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>. I talked about the dance, and you ought to make some </p>
	<p>sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples."</p>
	<p>He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.</p>
	<p>"Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But now we may be silent."</p>
	<p>"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?"</p>
	<p>"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of some, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible."</p>
	<p>"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"</p>
	<p>"Both," replied <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> archly; "for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."</p>
	<p>"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure," said he. "How near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say. You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."</p>
	<p>"I must not decide on my own performance."</p>
	<p>He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance."</p>
	<p>The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on. At length <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> spoke, and in a constrained manner said, "<persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends---whether he may be equally capable of retaining them, is less certain."</p>
	<p>"He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship," replied <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life."</p>
	<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At that moment, <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename><surname>Lucas</surname></persName> appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.</p>
	<p>"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>. Such very superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Eliza</forename></persName> (glancing at her sister and<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>:--but let me not interrupt you, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>. You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."</p>
	<p>The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> and<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, "<roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."</p>
	<p>"I do not think we were speaking at all. <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName>could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."</p>
	<p>"What think you of books?" said he, smiling.</p>
	<p>"Books---oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings."</p>
	<p>"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions."</p>
	<p>"No---I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else."</p>
	<p>"The present always occupies you in such scenes---does it?" said he, with a look of doubt.</p>
	<p>"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created."</p>
	<p>"I am," said he, with a firm voice.</p>
	<p>"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"</p>
	<p>"I hope not."</p>
	<p>"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first."</p>
	<p>"May I ask to what these questions tend?"</p>
	<p>"Merely to the illustration of your character," said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity. "I am trying to make it out."</p>
	<p>"And what is your success?"</p>
	<p>She shook her head. "I do not get on at all. I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."</p>
	<p>"I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."</p>
	<p>"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity."</p>
	<p>"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.</p>
	<p>They had not long separated, when <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:</p>
	<p>"So, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName>Miss</addName><forename>Eliza</forename></persName>, I hear you are quite delighted with George  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was the son of old  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, the late <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been remarkably kind to him, though George  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> has treated <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how </p>
	<p>he could presume to do it. I pity you, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName>Miss</addName><forename>Eliza</forename></persName>, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much better."</p>
	<p>"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s steward, and of that, I can assure you, he informed me himself."</p>
	<p>"I beg your pardon," replied <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, turning away with a sneer. "Excuse my interference---it was kindly meant."</p>
	<p>"Insolent girl!" said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> to herself. "You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>." She then sought her eldest sister, who has undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s being in the fairest way for happiness.</p>
	<p>"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon."</p>
	<p>"No," replied<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you. <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> has deserved much less attention from <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's, <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s regard."</p>
	<p>"<persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> does not know <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> himself?"</p>
	<p>"No; he never saw him till the other morning at <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>."</p>
	<p>"This account then is what he has received from <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?"</p>
	<p>"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> more than once, but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only."</p>
	<p>"I have not a doubt of <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s sincerity," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before."</p>
	<p>She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> entertained of <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> himself, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> withdrew to <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> came up to them, and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.</p>
	<p>"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"> <roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename><nameLink>de</nameLink><surname>Bourgh</surname> </persName> in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."</p>
	<p>"You are not going to introduce yourself to <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>!"</p>
	<p>"Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>'s nephew. It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong to <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance. <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking, replied thus:</p>
	<p>"My dear Miss <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, I have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom---provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, whose reception of his advances she eagerly </p>
	<p>watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology," "Hunsford," and "<persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"> <roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename><nameLink>de</nameLink><surname>Bourgh</surname> </persName>." It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> then returned to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>.</p>
	<p>"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my reception. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>'s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."</p>
	<p>As <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s two sisters. Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (<persName key="LadyLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>) freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> would soon be married to <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>. It was an animating subject, and <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> seemed incapable of fatigue while </p>
	<p>enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that <persName key="LadyLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was </p>
	<p>no chance of it.</p>
	<p>In vain did <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.</p>
	<p>"What is <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear."</p>
	<p>"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you to offend <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!"</p>
	<p>Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.</p>
	<p>At length, however, <addName>Mrs.</addName>. Bennet had no more to say; and <persName key="LadyLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> now began to revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName>, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain; <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName>, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a </p>
	<p>minute began another. <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName>'s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was in agonies. She looked at<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, to see how she bore it; but <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was very composedly talking to<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> should be singing all night. He took the hint, and when <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> had finished her second song, said aloud, "That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."</p>
	<p><persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName>, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.</p>
	<p>"If I," said <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manner towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think </p>
	<p>well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family." And with a bow to <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared---many smiled; but no one looked more amused than <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> himself, while his wife seriously commended <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to <persName key="LadyLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.</p>
	<p>To <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his two sisters and <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.</p>
	<p>The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s conversation to herself.</p>
	<p>She was at least free from the offense of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s further notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, and rejoiced in it.</p>
	<p>The <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by a manoeuvre of <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. <persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> and her sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, who was complimenting <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> and his sisters on the elegance of</p>
	<p>their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> said nothing at all. <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> and <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> preserved as steady a silence as either <persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> or <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>; and even <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord, how tired I am!" accompanied by a</p>
	<p>violent yawn.</p>
	<p>When at length they arose to take leave, <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> , and addressed herself especially to <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.</p>
	<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> in the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter married to <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> and <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>.</p>

    <head>Chapter 19</head>
	<p>The next day opened a new scene at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> . <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> made his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:</p>
	<p>"May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?"</p>
	<p>Before <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had time for anything but a blush of surprise, <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> answered instantly, "Oh dear!--yes---certainly. I am sure <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName> will be very happy---I am sure she can have no objection. Come, <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, I want you upstairs." And, gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> called out:</p>
	<p>"Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> must excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am going away myself."</p>
	<p>"No, no, nonsense, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>. I desire you to stay where you are." And upon <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed</p>
	<p>looks, about to escape, she added: "<persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, I insist upon your staying and hearing <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>would not oppose such an injunction---and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> and <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> walked off, and as soon as they were gone, <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> began.</p>
	<p>"Believe me, my dear Miss <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying---and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did."</p>
	<p>The idea of <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> so near laughing, that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further, and he continued:</p>
	<p>"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly---which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford---between our pools at quadrille, while <addName>Mrs.</addName> Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, '<persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit </p>
	<p>her.' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"> <roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename><nameLink>de</nameLink><surname>Bourgh</surname> </persName> as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place---which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has </p>
	<p>been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains but for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."</p>
	<p>It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.</p>
	<p>"You are too hasty, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>," she cried. "You forget that I have made no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them."</p>
	<p>"I am not now to learn," replied <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."</p>
	<p>"Upon my word, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>," cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of</p>
	<p>being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so. Nay, were your friend <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation."</p>
	<p>"Were it certain that <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> would think so," said <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> very gravely---"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification."</p>
	<p>"Indeed, <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> not thus addressed her:</p>
	<p>"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character."</p>
	<p>"Really, <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>," cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> with some warmth, "you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one."</p>
	<p>"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly de<roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>able. My situation in life, my connections with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."</p>
	<p>"I do assure you, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart."</p>
	<p>"You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable."</p>
	<p>To such perseverance in wilful self-deception <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behavior at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.</p>

    <head>Chapter 20</head>
	<p><persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect or their nearer connection. <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.</p>
	<p>This information, however, startled <addName>Mr.</addName>. Bennet; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.</p>
	<p>"But, depend upon it, <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>," she added, "that <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName> shall be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will make her know it."</p>
	<p>"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very de<roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>able wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."</p>
	<p>"<roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>, you quite misunderstand me," said <addName>Mr.</addName>. Bennet, alarmed. "<persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName> is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."</p>
	<p>She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library, "Oh! <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName> marry <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her."</p>
	<p><persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.</p>
	<p>"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had finished her speech. "Of what are you talking?"</p>
	<p>"Of <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName> declares she will not have <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, and <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> begins to say that he will not have <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>."</p>
	<p>"And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business."</p>
	<p>"Speak to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName> about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him."</p>
	<p>"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion."</p>
	<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> rang the bell, and Miss <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was summoned to the library.</p>
	<p>"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared. "I have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?" <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> replied that it was. "Very well---and this offer of marriage you have refused?"</p>
	<p>"I have, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>."</p>
	<p>"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>?"</p>
	<p>"Yes, or I will never see her again."</p>
	<p>"An unhappy alternative is before you, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, and I will never see you again if you do."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.</p>
	<p>"What do you mean, <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, in talking this way? You promised me to insist upon her marrying him."</p>
	<p>"My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be."</p>
	<p>Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> give up the point. She talked to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> in her interest; but<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, with all possible mildness, declined interfering; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her determination never did.</p>
	<p><persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.</p>
	<p>While the family were in this confusion, <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  Lucas came to spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> has made an offer to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, and she will not have him."</p>
	<p><persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName> to comply with the wishes of all her family. "Pray do, my dear <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves."</p>
	<p><persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> 's reply was spared by the entrance of <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>.</p>
	<p>"Aye, there she comes," continued <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>---if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all---and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep you---and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied."</p>
	<p>Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them, till they were joined by <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, who entered the room with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, "Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> have a little conversation together."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>passed quietly out of the room, <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> and <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> followed, but <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> , detained first by the civility of <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a doleful voice <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> began the projected conversation: "Oh! <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>!"</p>
	<p>"My dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point. Far be it from me," he presently continued, in a voice that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the evil duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead </p>
	<p>of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="21">	
    <head>Chapter 21</head>
	<p>The discussion of <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s offer was now nearly at an end, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>, whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.</p>
	<p>The morrow produced no abatement of <addName>Mr.</addName>. Bennet's ill-humour or ill health. <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> was also in the same state of angry pride. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.</p>
	<p>After breakfast, the girls walked to <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName> to inquire if <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> were returned, and to lament over his absence from the <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> ball. He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their aunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was well talked over. To <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self-imposed.</p>
	<p>"I found," said he, "as the time drew near that I had better not meet <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself."</p>
	<p>She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> and another officer walked back with them to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> , and during the walk he particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.</p>
	<p>Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>; and no sooner had he and he companion taken leave, than a glance from <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> invited her to follow her upstairs. When they had gained their own room,<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, taking out the letter, said:</p>
	<p>"This is from <persName key="CarolineBingley"><forename>Caroline</forename><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>; what it contains has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> by this time, and are on their way to town---and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says."</p>
	<p>She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where <persName key="MrHurst"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> had a house. The next was in these words: "I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that." To these highflown expressions <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> would prevent <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.</p>
	<p>"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> will not be detained in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> by them."</p>
	<p>"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:"</p>
	<p>"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when <persName key="CharlesBingley"><forename>Charles</forename></persName> gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd---but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you."</p>
	<p>"It is evident by this," added<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, "that he comes back no more this winter."</p>
	<p>"It is only evident that <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> does not mean that he should."</p>
	<p>"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own master. But you do not know all. I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from you."</p>
	<p>"<persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><forename>Georgiana</forename> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in<persName key="LouisaHurst"><forename>Louisa</forename></persName> and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will</p>
	<p>have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call <persName key="CharlesBingley"><forename>Charles</forename></persName> most capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?"</p>
	<p>"What do you think of this sentence, my dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>?" said <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> as she finished it. "Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that<persName key="CarolineBingley"><forename>Caroline</forename></persName> neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"</p>
	<p>"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?"</p>
	<p>"Most willingly."</p>
	<p>"You shall have it in a few words. <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>. She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you."</p>
	<p><persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> shook her head.</p>
	<p>"Indeed,<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection. <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, I am sure, cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> for her brother, from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, you cannot seriously imagine that because <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> tells you her brother greatly admires <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."</p>
	<p>"If we thought alike of <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>," replied<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, "your representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust.<persName key="CarolineBingley"><forename>Caroline</forename></persName> is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself."</p>
	<p>"That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."</p>
	<p>"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?"</p>
	<p>"You must decide for yourself," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; "and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him."</p>
	<p>"How can you talk so?" said<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, faintly smiling. "You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate."</p>
	<p>"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion."</p>
	<p>"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. A thousand things may arise in six months!"</p>
	<p>The idea of his returning no more <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> treated with the utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of<persName key="CarolineBingley"><forename>Caroline</forename></persName>'s interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.</p>
	<p>She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> would return to <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> and answer every wish of her heart.</p>
	<p>They agreed that <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> would be soon down again and soon dining at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.</p>

    <head>Chapter 22</head>
	<p>The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the day was <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> so kind as to listen to <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> took an opportunity of thanking her. "It keeps him in good humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express." <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> 's kindness extended farther than <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>'s scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas </p>
	<p>Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.</p>
	<p>In as short a time as <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.</p>
	<p><persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName>and <persName key="LadyLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. <persName key="LadyLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was likely to live; and <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName>gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> should be in possession of the <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> 's dying an old maid. <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time to </p>
	<p>consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged <addName>Mr.</addName> </p>
	<p>Collins, when he returned to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.</p>
	<p>As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  again, whenever his engagements might</p>
	<p>allow him to visit them.</p>
	<p>"My dear madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible."</p>
	<p>They were all astonished; and <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:</p>
	<p>"But is there not danger of <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>'s disapprobation here, my good <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness."</p>
	<p>"My dear <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>," replied <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, "I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."</p>
	<p>"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence."</p>
	<p>"Believe me, my dear <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>."</p>
	<p>With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> might have been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away. <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> related the event of the day before.</p>
	<p>The possibility of <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s fancying herself in love with her friend had once occurred to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> within the last day or two; but that <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:</p>
	<p>"Engaged to <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>! My dear <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> ---impossible!"</p>
	<p>The steady countenance which <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied:</p>
	<p>"Why should you be surprised, my dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Eliza</forename></persName>? Do you think it incredible that <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"</p>
	<p>But <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.</p>
	<p>"I see what you are feeling," replied <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> . "You must be surprised, very much surprised---so lately as <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>quietly answered "Undoubtedly;" and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  did not stay much longer, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> 's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  the wife of <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="23">	
    <head>Chapter 23</head>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it, when <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename><surname>Lucas</surname></persName> himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter---to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:</p>
	<p>"Good Lord! <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know that <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> wants to marry <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>?"</p>
	<p>Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.</p>
	<p>Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> William, in which she was readily joined by<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>.</p>
	<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName>remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName>or <persName key="LadyLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.</p>
	<p><persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!</p>
	<p><persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> persuade her to consider it as improbable. <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> were far from envying <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>, for <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>.</p>
	<p><persName key="LadyLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.</p>
	<p>Between <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> and <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her disappointment in <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return.</p>
	<p><persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> had sent<persName key="CarolineBingley"><forename>Caroline</forename></persName> an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of thanks from <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName>, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.</p>
	<p><persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, and they gave way only to the greater distress of <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s continued absence.</p>
	<p>Neither <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> nor <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> were comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName> of his coming no more to <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> the whole winter; a report which highly incensed <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood. </p>
	<p>Even <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> began to fear---not that<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was indifferent---but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> and the amusements of <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.</p>
	<p>As for<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, her anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s, but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed all<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.</p>
	<p><persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his reception at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.</p>
	<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  came to see them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, was convinced that they were talking of the <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> were dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.</p>
	<p>"Indeed, <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>," said she, "it is very hard to think that <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for her, and live to see her take her place in it!"</p>
	<p>"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor."</p>
	<p>This was not very consoling to <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before.</p>
	<p>"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it."</p>
	<p>"What should not you mind?"</p>
	<p>"I should not mind anything at all."</p>
	<p>"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility."</p>
	<p>"I never can be thankful, <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> too! Why should he have it more than anybody else?"</p>
	<p>"I leave it to yourself to determine," said <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>.</p>

    <head>Chapter 24</head>
	<p><persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.</p>
	<p>Hope was over, entirely over; and when <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and <persName key="CarolineBingley"><forename>Caroline</forename></persName> boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.</p>
	<p>Elizabeth, to whom <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all others. To <persName key="CarolineBingley"><forename>Caroline</forename></persName>'s assertion of her brother's being partial to <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> she paid no credit. That he was really fond of<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing else; and yet </p>
	<p>whether<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.</p>
	<p>A day or two passed before <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> had courage to speak of her feelings to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; but at last, on <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> and its master, she could not help saying:</p>
	<p>"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.</p>
	<p>"You doubt me," cried<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, slightly colouring; "indeed, you have no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not that pain. A little time, therefore---I shall certainly try to get the better."</p>
	<p>With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself."</p>
	<p>"My dear<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>!" exclaimed <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "you are too good. Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve."</p>
	<p>Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection.</p>
	<p>"Nay," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "this is not fair. You wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want to think you perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> 's marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!"</p>
	<p>"My dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s</p>
	<p>respectability, and <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> 's steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin."</p>
	<p>"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness."</p>
	<p>"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>; "and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You mentioned two instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, not to pain me by thinking that person to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does."</p>
	<p>"And men take care that they should."</p>
	<p>"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."</p>
	<p>"I am far from attributing any part of <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s conduct to design," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business."</p>
	<p>"And do you impute it to either of those?"</p>
	<p>"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can."</p>
	<p>"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?"</p>
	<p>"Yes, in conjunction with his friend."</p>
	<p>"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it."</p>
	<p>"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride."</p>
	<p>"Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>," replied<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistaken---or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>could not oppose such a wish; and from this time <addName>Mrs.</addName><persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.</p>
	<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> did not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. <addName>Mrs.</addName>Bennet's best comfort was that <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> must be down again in the summer.</p>
	<p><persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> treated the matter differently. "So, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName> to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."</p>
	<p>"Thank you, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not all expect<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s good fortune."</p>
	<p>"True," said <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, "but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it."</p>
	<p><persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The whole of what <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had already heard, his claims on <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> before they had known anything of the matter.</p>
	<p>Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes---but by everybody else <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was condemned as the worst of men.</p>

    <head>Chapter 25</head>
	<p>After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> was called from his amiable <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  by the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.</p>
	<p>On the following Monday, <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> . <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, who was several years younger than</p>
	<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> and <persName key="MrsPhillips"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town.</p>
	<p>The first part of <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>'s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.</p>
	<p>"I do not blame<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>," she continued, "for <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> would have got <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> if she could. But <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that she might have been <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s wife by this time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that <persName key="LadyLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> will have a daughter married before I have, and that the <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>  estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."</p>
	<p><persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation.</p>
	<p>When alone with <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. "It seems likely to have been a desirable match for<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>," said she. "I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent."</p>
	<p>"An excellent consolation in its way," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "but it will not do for us. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before."</p>
	<p>"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how violent was <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s love?"</p>
	<p>"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"</p>
	<p>"Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to you, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service---and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence. </p>
	<p>"I hope," added <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her."</p>
	<p>"And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> would no more suffer him to call on <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> in such a part of <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> never stirs without him."</p>
	<p>"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> correspond with his sister? She will not be able to help calling."</p>
	<p>"She will drop the acquaintance entirely."</p>
	<p>But in spite of the certainty in which <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s being withheld from seeing<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s attractions.</p>
	<p>Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she hoped by <persName key="CarolineBingley"><forename>Caroline</forename></persName>'s not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.</p>
	<p>The Gardiners stayed a week at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>; and what with the Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it---of which officers <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> was sure to be one; and on these occasion, <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, rendered suspicious by <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.</p>
	<p>To <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>,  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName>  to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> had been little there since the death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring.</p>
	<p><persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> had seen <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>, and known the late <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> by character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> with the minute description which  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected having heard <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured</p>
	<p>boy.</p>

	<p><persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>'s caution to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:</p>
	<p>"You are too sensible a girl, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father."</p>
	<p>"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."</p>
	<p>"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."</p>
	<p>"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it."</p>
	<p>"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."</p>
	<p>"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw---and if he becomes really attached to me---I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! that abominable <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>! My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with </p>
	<p>him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best."</p>
	<p>"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you should not remind you mother of inviting him."</p>
	<p>"As I did the other day," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> with a conscious smile: "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied."</p>
	<p>Her aunt assured her that she was, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.</p>
	<p><persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she "_wished_ they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room. As they went downstairs together, <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  said:</p>
	<p>"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Eliza</forename></persName>."</p>
	<p>"_That_ you certainly shall."</p>
	<p>"And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?"</p>
	<p>"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."</p>
	<p>"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.</p>
	<p>"My father and Maria are coming to me in March," added <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> , "and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Eliza</forename></persName>, you will be as welcome as either of them."</p>
	<p>The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> 's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> felt that <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>'s behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It was <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest.</p>
	<p><persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>; and when she wrote again, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.</p>
	<p>Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from <persName key="CarolineBingley"><forename>Caroline</forename></persName>. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> had by some accident been lost.</p>
	<p>"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street."</p>
	<p>She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>. "I did not think <persName key="CarolineBingley"><forename>Caroline</forename></persName>in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as <persName key="CarolineBingley"><forename>Caroline</forename></persName>and <persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> were going out. I dare say I shall see them soon here."</p>
	<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that accident only could discover to <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> her sister's being in town.</p>
	<p>Four weeks passed away, and <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt.</p>
	<p>"My dearest <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName> will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. <persName key="CarolineBingley"><forename>Caroline</forename></persName>did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very </p>
	<p>wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. </p>
	<p>But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy---your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very soon. <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> said something of his never returning to <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName>and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.---Yours, etc."</p>
	<p>This letter gave <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s sister, as by  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.</p>
	<p><persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> about this time reminded <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> 's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure </p>
	<p>for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.</p>
	<p>All this was acknowledged to <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on: "I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards him; they are even impartial towards  <persName key="MaryKing"><addName>Miss</addName><surname>King</surname></persName>. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live </p>
	<p>on as well as the plain."</p>

    <head>Chapter 27</head>
<p>With no greater events than these in the <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>"><placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> , she soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  again, and weakened her disgust of <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>. There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> 's first sketch. She was to accompany <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName>and his second </p>
<p>daughter. The improvement of spending a night in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.</p>
<p>The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.</p>
<p>The farewell between herself and <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"> <roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename><nameLink>de</nameLink><surname>Bourgh</surname> </persName>, and trusting their opinion of her---their opinion of everybody---would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.</p>
<p>Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable. <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename><surname>Lucas</surname></persName>, and his daughter Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> loved absurdities, but she had known <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his information.</p>
<p>It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>'s door, <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that though <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long. <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> gave her the particulars also of <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.</p>
<p><persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> then rallied her niece on <persName key="GeorgeWickham">Wickham</persName>'s desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.</p>
<p>"But my dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>," she added, "what sort of girl is  <persName key="MaryKing"><addName>Miss</addName><surname>King</surname></persName>? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."</p>
<p>"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary."</p>
<p>"If you will only tell me what sort of girl  <persName key="MaryKing"><addName>Miss</addName><surname>King</surname></persName> is, I shall know what to think."</p>
<p>"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her."</p>
<p>"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune."</p>
<p>"No---what should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain my affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?"</p>
<p>"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event."</p>
<p>"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe. If she does not object to it, why should we?"</p>
<p>"_Her_ not objecting does not justify him. It only shows her being deficient in something herself---sense or feeling."</p>
<p>"Well," cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "have it as you choose. He shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish."</p>
<p>"No, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, that is what I do not choose. I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName> ."</p>
<p>"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName> ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all."</p>
<p>"Take care, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."</p>
<p>Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.</p>
<p>"We have not determined how far it shall carry us," said <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, "but, perhaps, to the Lakes."</p>
<p>No scheme could have been more agreeable to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. "Oh, my dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We will know where we have gone---we will recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."</p>

<div type="chapter" n="28">
<head>Chapter 28</head>

<p>Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.</p>
<p>When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> and <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, </p>
<p>with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> . Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>, <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and </p>
<p>to the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> admired the command of countenance with which <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many tress there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.</p>
<p>From his garden, <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> would have led them round his two meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName>accompanied him, <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> gave <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  all the credit. When <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> 's evident enjoyment of it, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> supposed he must be often forgotten.</p>
<p>She had already learnt that <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> was still in the country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> joining in, observed:</p>
<p>"Yes, Miss <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, you will have the honour of seeing <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"> <roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename><nameLink>de</nameLink><surname>Bourgh</surname> </persName> on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I should say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."</p>
<p>"<persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> , "and a most attentive neighbour."</p>
<p>"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."</p>
<p>The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> 's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.</p>
<p>About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out---</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Eliza</forename></persName>! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.</p>
<p>"And is this all?" cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>. "I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> and her daughter."</p>
<p>"La! my dear," said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>. The old lady is <addName>Mrs.</addName> Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?"</p>
<p>"She is abominably rude to keep <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?"</p>
<p>"Oh, <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in."</p>
<p>"I like her appearance," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, struck with other ideas. "She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife."</p>
<p><persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> and <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> William, to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.</p>
<p>At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house. <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.</p>
</div>

<div type="chapter" n="29">
<head>Chapter 29</head>
<p><persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>'s condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.</p>
<p>"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!"</p>
<p>"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> William, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."</p>
<p>Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings. <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.</p>
<p>When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>---</p>
<p>"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest---there is no occasion for anything more. <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved."</p>
<p>While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St. James's.</p>
<p>As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost <persName key="LewisdeBourgh"> <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>Lewis</forename><nameLink>de</nameLink><surname>Bourgh</surname> </persName>.</p>
<p>When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName>did not look perfectly calm. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation.</p>
<p>From the entrance-hall, of which <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, her daughter, and <addName>Mrs.</addName> Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.</p>
<p>In spite of having been at St. James's <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName>was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> immediately to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> to be exactly what he represented.</p>
<p>When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to <addName>Mrs.</addName> Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.</p>
<p>After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> attending them to point out its beauties, and <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.</p>
<p>The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> wondered <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> could bear. But <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  and Miss de Bourgh---the former of whom was engaged in listening to <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. <addName>Mrs.</addName> Jenkinson was </p>
<p>chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.</p>
<p>When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted. She inquired into <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> 's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many </p>
<p>sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name? <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly. <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> then observed,</p>
<p>"Your father's estate is entailed on <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, I think. For your sake," turning to <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> , "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought necessary in <persName key="LewisdeBourgh"> <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>Lewis</forename><nameLink>de</nameLink><surname>Bourgh</surname> </persName>'s family. Do you</p>
<p>play and sing, Miss Bennet?"</p>
<p>"A little."</p>
<p>"Oh! then---some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?"</p>
<p>"One of them does."</p>
<p>"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do you draw?"</p>
<p>"No, not at all."</p>
<p>"What, none of you?"</p>
<p>"Not one."</p>
<p>"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."</p>
<p>"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>."</p>
<p>"Has your governess left you?"</p>
<p>"We never had any governess."</p>
<p>"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case.</p>
<p>"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must have been neglected."</p>
<p>"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might."</p>
<p>"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of <addName>Mrs.</addName> Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. '<persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am, all."</p>
<p>"All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters must be very young?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps she is full young to be much in company. But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth at the first. And to be kept back on such a motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind."</p>
<p>"Upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?"</p>
<p>"With three younger sisters grown up," replied <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, smiling, "your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."</p>
<p><persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.</p>
<p>"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age."</p>
<p>"I am not one-and-twenty."</p>
<p>When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were placed. <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> William, and <addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting <addName>Mrs.</addName> Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when <addName>Mrs.</addName> Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the other table. <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> was generally speaking---stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many. <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName>did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.</p>
<p>When <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered round the fire to hear <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s side and as many bows on <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> William's they departed. As soon as they had driven from the door, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> 's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands.</p>
</div>

<div type="chapter" n="30">
<head>Chapter 30</head>
<p><persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName>stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with. While <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName>was with them, <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room, which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had at first rather wondered that <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, </p>
<p>for <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  credit for the arrangement.</p>
<p>From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> , but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out.</p>
<p>Very few days passed in which <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s joints of meat were too large for her family.</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.</p>
<p>The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> William, and there being only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s reach. This, however, was no evil to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> , and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>'s curiosity.</p>
<p>In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had heard soon after her arrival that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by <persName key="LadyLucas"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> and herself.</p>
<p>His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> to require them, for <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> had brought with him a <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> , the younger son of his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> returned, the gentleman accompanied him. <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:</p>
<p>"I may thank you, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Eliza</forename></persName>, for this piece of civility. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> would never have come so soon to wait upon me."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> , who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire---paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with every appearance of composure. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.</p>
<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName>  entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, sat for some time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added:</p>
<p>"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never happened to see her there?"</p>
<p>She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.</p>

<div type="chapter" n="31">
<head>Chapter 31</head>
<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> 's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither---for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little of <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> or her daughter. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName>  had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> they had seen only at church.</p>
<p>The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>'s drawing-room. Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.</p>
<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName>  seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> herself, as well as of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>. His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out:</p>
<p>"What is that you are saying, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> ? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is."</p>
<p>"We are speaking of music, madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.</p>
<p>"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music. There are few people in  <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> , I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully. How does <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><forename>Georgiana</forename></persName>get on, Darcy?"</p>
<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.</p>
<p>"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal."</p>
<p>"I assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice. She practises very constantly."</p>
<p>"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well unless she practises more; and though <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in <addName>Mrs.</addName> Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house."</p>
<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-breeding, and made no answer.</p>
<p>When coffee was over, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName>  reminded <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:</p>
<p>"You mean to frighten me, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, by coming in all this state to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me."</p>
<p>"I shall not say you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> , "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire---and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too---for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear."</p>
<p>"I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.</p>
<p>"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> . "I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."</p>
<p>"You shall hear then---but prepare yourself for something very dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball---and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, you cannot deny the fact."</p>
<p>"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party."</p>
<p>"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> , what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers."</p>
<p>"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, still addressing <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> . "Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"</p>
<p>"I can answer your question," said <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> , "without applying to him. It is because he will not give himself the</p>
<p>trouble."</p>
<p>"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done." </p>
<p>"My fingers," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault---because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution."</p>
<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> smiled and said, "You are perfectly right. You have employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers."</p>
<p>Here they were interrupted by <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, who called out to know what they were talking of. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> immediately began playing again. <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy:</p>
<p>"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> master. She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>looked at <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, that he might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his relation.</p>
<p><persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> continued her remarks on <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> received them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.</p>
</div>

<div type="chapter" n="32">
<head>Chapter 32</head>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> while <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, and <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> only, entered the room.</p>
<p>He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within.</p>
<p>They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:</p>
<p>"How very suddenly you all quitted <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> last November, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly so, I thank you."</p>
<p>She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short pause added:</p>
<p>"I think I have understood that <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> has not much idea of ever returning to <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> again?"</p>
<p>"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing."</p>
<p>"If he means to be but little at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle."</p>
<p>"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up</p>
<p>as soon as any eligible purchase offers."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.</p>
<p>He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable house. <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, I believe, did a great deal to it when <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> first came to Hunsford."</p>
<p>"I believe she did---and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object."</p>
<p>"<persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife."</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding---though I am not certain that I consider her marrying <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her."</p>
<p>"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends."</p>
<p>"An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles."</p>
<p>"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance."</p>
<p>"I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match," cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>. "I should never have said <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> was settled near her family."</p>
<p>"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>, I suppose, would appear far."</p>
<p>As he spoke there was a sort of smile which <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> and <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>, and she blushed as she answered:</p>
<p>"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case here. <addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys---and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance."</p>
<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. You cannot have been always at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:</p>
<p>"Are you pleased with Kent?"</p>
<p>A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise---and soon put an end to by the entrance of <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised them. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.</p>
<p>"What can be the meaning of this?" said <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> , as soon as he was gone. "My dear, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Eliza</forename></persName>, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called us in this familiar way."</p>
<p>But when <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> told of his silence; it did not seem very likely, even to <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> 's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there was <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName>  came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident </p>
<p>admiration of her, of her former favourite  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><forename>George</forename><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> 's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.</p>
<p>But why <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice---a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> knew not what to make of him. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> 's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Eliza</forename></persName>, she set herself seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration </p>
<p>in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.</p>
<p>She had once or twice suggested to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> the possibility of his being partial to her, but <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> always laughed at the idea; and <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.</p>
<p>In her kind schemes for <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, she sometimes planned her marrying <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> . He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.</p>

<p>More than once did <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>. She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions---about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of <addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the </p>
<p>house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName>  in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.</p>
<p>She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, she saw on looking up that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName>  was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:</p>
<p>"I did not know before that you ever walked this way."</p>
<p>"I have been making the tour of the park," he replied, "as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?"</p>
<p>"No, I should have turned in a moment."</p>
<p>And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.</p>
<p>"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.</p>
<p>"Yes---if <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases."</p>
<p>"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>."</p>
<p>"He likes to have his own way very well," replied <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> . "But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence."</p>
<p>"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?"</p>
<p>"These are home questions---and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like."</p>
<p>"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do."</p>
<p>"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are too many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money."</p>
<p>"Is this," thought <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."</p>
<p>He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said:</p>
<p>"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her."</p>
<p>"No," said <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> , "that is an advantage which he must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>."</p>
<p>"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> spirit, she may like to have her own way."</p>
<p>As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:</p>
<p>"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, <persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> and <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>. I think I have heard you say that you know them."</p>
<p>"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man---he is a great friend of Darcy's."</p>
<p>"Oh! yes," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> drily; "<persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> is uncommonly kind to <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."</p>
<p>"Care of him! Yes, I really believe <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> does take care of him in those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was the person meant. It was all conjecture."</p>
<p>"What is it you mean?"</p>
<p>"It is a circumstance which <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing."</p>
<p>"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."</p>
<p>"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."</p>
<p>"Did <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> give you reasons for this interference?"</p>
<p>"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady."</p>
<p>"And what arts did he use to separate them?"</p>
<p>"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName>, smiling. "He only told me what I have now told you."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation. After watching her a little, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName>  asked her why she was so thoughtful.</p>
<p>"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she. "Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?"</p>
<p>"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"</p>
<p>"I do not see what right <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy. But," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case."</p>
<p>"That is not an unnatural surmise," said <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> , "but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."</p>
<p>This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the world two men over whom <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> could have such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> and <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> the principal design and arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, he was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, </p>
<p>generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.</p>
<p>"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> 's words; and those strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>.</p>
<p>"To <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never each." When she thought of her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> for his sister.</p>
<p>The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to her unwillingness to see <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> could not conceal his apprehension of <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>'s being rather displeased by her staying at home.</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" n="34">
<head>Chapter 34</head>
<p>When they were gone, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> had written to her since her being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next---and, a still greater, that in less than a </p>
<p>fortnight she should herself be with <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.</p>
<p>She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName>  had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.</p>
<p>While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName>  himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> walk into the room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:</p>
<p>"In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you."</p>
<p>Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority---of its being a degradation---of the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.</p>
<p>In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He spoke of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said:</p>
<p>"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could feel gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot---I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation."</p>
<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. The pause was to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s feelings dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:</p>
<p>"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance."</p>
<p>"I might as well inquire," replied she, "why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against you---had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?"</p>
<p>As she pronounced these words, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued:</p>
<p>"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there. You dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other---of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind."</p>
<p>She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.</p>
<p>"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated.</p>
<p>With assumed tranquillity he then replied: "I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.</p>
<p>"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?"</p>
<p>"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.</p>
<p>"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?"</p>
<p>"His misfortunes!" repeated <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed."</p>
<p>"And of your infliction," cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> with energy. "You have reduced him to his present state of poverty---comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule."</p>
<p>"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:</p>
<p>"You are mistaken, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner."</p>
<p>She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:</p>
<p>"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it."</p>
<p>Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:</p>
<p>"From the very beginning---from the first moment, I may almost say---of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."</p>
<p>"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness."</p>
<p>And with these words he hastily left the room, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.</p>
<p>The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>! That he should have been in love with her for so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case---was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride---his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>---his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a </p>
<p>moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>'s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> 's observation, and hurried her away to her room.</p>
</div>

<div type="chapter" n="35">
<head>Chapter 35</head>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.</p>
<p>After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, she moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure, "I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour </p>
<p>of reading that letter?" And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.</p>
<p>With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--</p>
<p>"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.</p>
<p>"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. If, in the </p>
<p>explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.</p>
<p>"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename><surname>Lucas</surname></persName>'s accidental information, that<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his </p>
<p>attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. If you have not been mistaken here, I must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain---but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own </p>
<p>case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say farther that from </p>
<p>what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> for <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.</p>
<p>"The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>. We accordingly went---and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against </p>
<p>returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.</p>
<p>"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.</p>
<p>"<persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><forename>George</forename><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge---most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manner were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities---the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly </p>
<p>the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> could not have. Here again shall give you pain---to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character---it adds even another motive.</p>
<p>"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow---and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. I knew that <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> </p>
<p>ought not to be a clergyman; the business was therefore soon settled---he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him to <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question---of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was </p>
<p>well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances---and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.</p>
<p>"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> , and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to <placeName key="Ramsgate"><settlement type="city">Ramsgate</settlement></placeName> ; and thither also went <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and <addName>Mrs.</addName> Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after </p>
<p>stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, who left the place immediately, and <addName>Mrs.</addName> Younge was of course removed from her charge. <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed.</p>
<p>"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.</p>
<p>"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> , who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.</p>

<p>If <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, when <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she</p>
<p>read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what had happened at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of</p>
<p>doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence.</p>
<p>But when this subject was succeeded by his account of <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>---when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself---her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"---and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.</p>
<p>In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> family was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great. What <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following </p>
<p>of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality---deliberated on the probability of each statement---but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.</p>
<p>The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> had described as the idleness and vice of many </p>
<p>years' continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName>  and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName>  himself---from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> would never have hazarded </p>
<p>such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration.</p>
<p>She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> and herself, in their first evening at <persName key="MrPhillips"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>'s. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>---that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> ball the very next week. She remembered also that, till the <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.</p>
<p>How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to  <persName key="MaryKing"><addName>Miss</addName><surname>King</surname></persName> were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, she could not but allow <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, when questioned by<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance---an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways---seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or </p>
<p>unjust---anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued---that even <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had his actions been what <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, was incomprehensible.</p>
<p>She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> nor <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.</p>
<p>"How despicably I have acted!" she cried; "I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself."</p>
<p>From herself to<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>---from <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> to<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s explanation there had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> 's opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his description of<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>. She felt that<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility.</p>
<p>When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.</p>
<p>The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before.</p>
<p>After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought---re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.</p>
<p>She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, only for a few minutes, to take leave---but that Colonel <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName>  had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> could but just affect concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName>  was no longer an object; she could think only of her letter.</p>
</div>

<div type="chapter" n="37">
<head>Chapter 37</head>
<p>The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened, to console <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>could not see <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> without recollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been. "What would she have said? how would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself.</p>
<p>Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. "I assure you, I feel it exceedingly," said <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>; "I believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings certainly increases."</p>
<p><persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.</p>
<p><persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:</p>
<p>"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer. <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> will be very glad of your company, I am sure."</p>
<p>"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town next Saturday."</p>
<p>"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two months. I told <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> so before you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> could certainly spare you for another fortnight."</p>
<p>"But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return."</p>
<p>"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay another month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you---and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."</p>
<p>"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan."</p>
<p><persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> seemed resigned. "<persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, you must send a servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my niece <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><forename>Georgiana</forename></persName>went to <placeName key="Ramsgate"><settlement type="city">Ramsgate</settlement></placeName>  last summer, I made a point of her having two men-servants go with her. <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, the daughter of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, of <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone."</p>
<p>"My uncle is to send a servant for us."</p>
<p>"Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to."</p>
<p><persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.</p>
<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the </p>
<p>evil. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had frequently united with <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> in an endeavour to check the imprudence of <persName key="CatherineBennet"><forename>Catherine</forename></persName> and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>, they would flirt with him; and while <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName> was within a walk of <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>, they would be going there forever.</p>
<p>Anxiety on<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s behalf was another prevailing concern; and <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s explanation, by restoring<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> had lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!</p>
<p>When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.</p>
<p>Their engagements at <placeName key="Rosings">Rosings</placeName> were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.</p>
<p>When they parted, <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.</p>
</div>

<div type="chapter" n="38">
<head>Chapter 38</head>
<p>On Saturday morning <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> and <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.</p>
<p>"I know not, Miss <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>," said he, "whether <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it. The favor of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> , and the kind attentions she had received, must make her feel the obliged. <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> was gratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:</p>
<p>"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our connection with <placeName key="Rosings">Rosings</placeName>, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>'s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at <placeName key="Rosings">Rosings</placeName>."</p>
<p>Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.</p>
<p>"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so. <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>'s great attentions to <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate---but on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each other."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang. Poor <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> ! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.</p>
<p>At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate parting between the friends, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was attended to the carriage by <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> in the winter, and his compliments to <addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at <placeName key="Rosings">Rosings</placeName>.</p>
<p>"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble</p>
<p>respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.</p>
<p>"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, "it seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have happened!"</p>
<p>"A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.</p>
<p>"We have dined nine times at <placeName key="Rosings">Rosings</placeName>, besides drinking tea there twice! How much I shall have to tell!"</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>added privately, "And how much I shall have to conceal!"</p>
<p>Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>'s house, where they were to remain a few days.</p>
<p><persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> looked well, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was to go home with her, and at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> there would be leisure enough for observation.</p>
<p>It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>, before she told her sister of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> which might only grieve her sister further.</p>
</div>

<div type="chapter" n="39">
<head>Chapter 39</head>
<p>It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> looking out of a dining-room upstairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.</p>
<p>After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?"</p>
<p>"And we mean to treat you all," added <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then, showing her purchases---"Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better."</p>
<p>And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>, and they are going in a fortnight."</p>
<p>"Are they indeed!" cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, with the greatest satisfaction.</p>
<p>"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!"</p>
<p>"Yes," thought <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>!"</p>
<p>"Now I have got some news for you," said <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, as they sat down at table. "What do you think? It is excellent news---capital news---and about a certain person we all like!"</p>
<p><persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay. <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> laughed, and said:</p>
<p>"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger of Wickham's marrying <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> King. There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> is safe."</p>
<p>"And <persName key="MaryKing"><forename>Mary</forename><surname>King</surname></persName>is safe!" added <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune."</p>
<p>"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him." </p>
<p>"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>.</p>
<p>"I am sure there is not on his. I will answer for it, he never cared three straws about her---who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?"</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself, the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!</p>
<p>As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>'s and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s purchases, were seated in it.</p>
<p>"How nicely we are all crammed in," cried <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>. "I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think. She says <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName> had better have taken <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName>'s. <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> and me were to spend the day there, and <persName key="HarrietForster"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> </p>
<p>promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, <persName key="HarrietForster"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> and me are such friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but <persName key="HarrietForster"><forename>Harriet</forename></persName> was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and <persName key="HarrietForster"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName>, and <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did <persName key="HarrietForster"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName>. I thought I should have died. And that made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."</p>
<p>With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, assisted by <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>'s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.</p>
<p>Their reception at home was most kind. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> rejoiced to see <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> say voluntarily to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>:</p>
<p>"I am glad you are come back, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>."</p>
<p>Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that occupied them: <persName key="LadyLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, who sat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.</p>
<p>"Oh! <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName>," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! As we went along, <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!"</p>
<p>To this <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for _me_--I should infinitely prefer a book."</p>
<p>But of this answer <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> heard not a word. She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> at all.</p>
<p>In the afternoon <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>, and to see how everybody went on; but <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to her of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to go---and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.</p>
<p>She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.</p>
</div>

<div type="chapter" n="40">
<p>Chapter 40</p>
<p>Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> and herself.</p>
<p>Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was sorry that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.</p>
<p>"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong," said she, "and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment!"</p>
<p>"Indeed," replied <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"</p>
<p>"Blame you! Oh, no."</p>
<p>"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?"</p>
<p>"No---I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."</p>
<p>"But you will know it, when I tell you what happened the very next day."</p>
<p>She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><forename>George</forename><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>. What a stroke was this for poor<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one without involving the other.</p>
<p>"This will not do," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; "you never will be able to make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's; but you shall do as you choose."</p>
<p>It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>.</p>
<p>"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she. "<persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>! Dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so."</p>
<p>"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather."</p>
<p>"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!"</p>
<p>"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it."</p>
<p>"I never thought <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do."</p>
<p>"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."</p>
<p>"<persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!"</p>
<p>"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> to <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, for now they do appear wholly undeserved."</p>
<p>"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham's character."</p>
<p>Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, "Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?"</p>
<p>"That it ought not to be attempted. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> has not authorised me to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName> to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say nothing about it."</p>
<p>"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate."</p>
<p>The tumult of <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other half of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. "And then," said she, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"</p>
<p>She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was not happy. She still cherished a very tender affection for<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>. Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.</p>
<p>"Well, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>," said <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> one day, "what is your opinion now of this sad business of<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> saw anything of him in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>. Well, he is a very undeserving young man---and I do not suppose there's the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming to <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> again in the summer; and I have inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know."</p>
<p>"I do not believe he will ever live at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> any more."</p>
<p>"Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> will die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done."</p>
<p>But as <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.</p>
<p>"Well, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>," continued her mother, soon afterwards, "and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  is an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, I dare say."</p>
<p>"No, nothing at all."</p>
<p>"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. they will take care not to outrun their income. They will never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> when your father is dead. They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens."</p>
<p>"It was a subject which they could not mention before me."</p>
<p>"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."</p>

<p>Chapter 41</p>
<p>The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the last of the regiment's stay in <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.</p>
<p>"Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. "How can you be smiling so, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>?"</p>
<p>Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years ago.</p>
<p>"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart."</p>
<p>"I am sure I shall break mine," said <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>.</p>
<p>"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable."</p>
<p>"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever."</p>
<p>"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good," added <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>.</p>
<p>Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> House. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.</p>
<p>But the gloom of <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from <persName key="HarrietForster"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName>, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> to each other, and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two.</p>
<p>The rapture of <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> on this occasion, her adoration of <persName key="HarrietForster"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName>, the delight of <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, and the mortification of <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.</p>
<p>"I cannot see why <persName key="HarrietForster"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> should not ask me as well as <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>," said she, "Though I am not her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."</p>
<p>In vain did <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> attempt to make her reasonable, and <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> to make her resigned. As for <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all the improprieties of <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as <persName key="HarrietForster"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName>, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:</p>
<p>"<persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances."</p>
<p>"If you were aware," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s unguarded and imprudent manner---nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair."</p>
<p>"Already arisen?" repeated <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>. "What, has she frightened away some of your lovers? Poor little <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>! But do not be cast down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s folly."</p>
<p>"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> also is comprehended. She will </p>
<p>follow wherever <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?"</p>
<p><persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and affectionately taking her hand said in reply:</p>
<p>"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> are known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of---or I may say, three---very silly sisters. We shall have no peace at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> if <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> does not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life."</p>
<p>With this answer <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.</p>
<p>Had <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility. In <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp---its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.</p>
<p>Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same. <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.</p>
<p>But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s leaving home.</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was now to see <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> for the last time. Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of formal partiality entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.</p>
<p>On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>, he dined, with other of the officers, at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>; and so little was <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> 's and <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s having both spent three weeks at <placeName key="Rosings">Rosings</placeName>, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.</p>
<p>He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:</p>
<p>"How long did you say he was at <placeName key="Rosings">Rosings</placeName>?"</p>
<p>"Nearly three weeks."</p>
<p>"And you saw him frequently?"</p>
<p>"Yes, almost every day."</p>
<p>"His manners are very different from his cousin's."</p>
<p>"Yes, very different. But I think <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> improves upon acquaintance."</p>
<p>"Indeed!" cried <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> with a look which did not escape her. "And pray, may I ask?--" But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, "Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."</p>
<p>"Oh, no!" said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>. "In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was."</p>
<p>While she spoke, <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added:</p>
<p>"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."</p>
<p>Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents:</p>
<p>"You, who so well know my feeling towards <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right. His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with the appearance, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.</p>
<p>When the party broke up, <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> returned with <persName key="HarrietForster"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> to <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>, from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible---advice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.</p>

<div type="chapter" n="42">
<head>Chapter 42</head>
<p>Had <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly of their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish </p>
<p>to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.</p>
<p>When <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had rejoiced over <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes been found before, that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity---to have some other point on which her wishes and </p>
<p>hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> made inevitable; and could she have included <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.</p>
<p>"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation."</p>
<p>When <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as <persName key="HarrietForster"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> called her, and they were going off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her</p>
<p>sister, there was still less to be learnt---for her letters to <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.</p>
<p>After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> was so much recovered as to be able to enter <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName> without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in <placeName key="Meryton">Meryton</placeName>.</p>
<p>The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> again within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName> . In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated </p>
<p>beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it was her business to be satisfied---and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.</p>
<p>With the mention of <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName>  there were many ideas connected. It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> and its owner. "But surely," said she, "I may enter his county without impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."</p>
<p>The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and <addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, with their four children, did at length appear at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way---teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.</p>
<p>The Gardiners stayed only one night at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>, and set off the next morning with <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment was certain---that of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences---cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure---and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.</p>
<p>It is not the object of this work to give a description of <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName>, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName> is all the present concern. To the little town of <placeName key="Lambton"><settlement type="county">Lambton</settlement></placeName> , the scene of <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>'s former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of <placeName key="Lambton"><settlement type="county">Lambton</settlement></placeName> , <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> found from her aunt that <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> was situated. It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking over their route the evening before, <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> expressed an inclination to see the place again. <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> declared his willingness, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was applied to for her approbation.</p>
<p>"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?" said her aunt; "a place, too, with which so many of your acquaintances are connected. <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> passed all his youth there, you know."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was distressed. She felt that she had no business at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.</p>
<p><persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> abused her stupidity. "If it were merely a fine house richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the country."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>said no more---but her mind could not acquiesce. The possibility of meeting <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, while viewing the place, instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered.</p>
<p>Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> were not a very fine place? what was the name of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question---and her alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme. To <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>, therefore, they were to go.</p>

<div type="chapter" n="43">
<p>Chapter 43</p>
<p>Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.</p>
<p>The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.</p>
<p>Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was delighted. She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> might be something!</p>
<p>They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.</p>
<p>The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the </p>
<p>furniture of <placeName key="Rosings">Rosings</placeName>.</p>
<p>"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,"---recollecting herself---"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them."</p>
<p>This was a lucky recollection---it saved her from something very like regret.</p>
<p>She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while <addName>Mrs.</addName> Reynolds replied that he was, adding, "But we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends." How rejoiced was <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!</p>
<p>Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the likeness of <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense. "He is now gone into the army," she added; "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."</p>
<p><persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> looked at her niece with a smile, but <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> could not return it.</p>
<p>"And that," said <addName>Mrs.</addName> Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my master---and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the other---about eight years ago."</p>
<p>"I have heard much of your master's fine person," said <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face. But, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, you can tell us whether it is like or not."</p>
<p><addName>Mrs.</addName> Reynolds respect for <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.</p>
<p>"Does that young lady know <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>?"</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>coloured, and said: "A little."</p>
<p>"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?"</p>
<p>"Yes, very handsome."</p>
<p>"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of them."</p>
<p>This accounted to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> for <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s being among them.</p>
<p><addName>Mrs.</addName> Reynolds then directed their attention to one of <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, drawn when she was only eight years old.</p>
<p>"And is <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> as handsome as her brother?" said <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>.</p>
<p>"Oh! yes---the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her---a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him."</p>
<p><persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; <addName>Mrs.</addName> Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.</p>
<p>"Is your master much at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> in the course of the year?"</p>
<p>"Not so much as I could wish, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> is always down for the summer months."</p>
<p>"Except," thought <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "when she goes to <placeName key="Ramsgate"><settlement type="city">Ramsgate</settlement></placeName> ."</p>
<p>"If your master would marry, you might see more of him."</p>
<p>"Yes, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know who is good enough for him."</p>
<p><addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> smiled. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> could not help saying, "It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so."</p>
<p>"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him," replied the other. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "I have never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old."</p>
<p>This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:</p>
<p>"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in having such a master."</p>
<p>"Yes, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>almost stared at her. "Can this be <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>?" thought she.</p>
<p>"His father was an excellent man," said <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>.</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him---just as affable to the poor."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. <addName>Mrs.</addName> Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain, <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.</p>
<p>"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men."</p>
<p>"In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>.</p>
<p>"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt as they walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend." </p>
<p>"Perhaps we might be deceived."</p>
<p>"That is not very likely; our authority was too good."</p>
<p>On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, who had taken a liking to the room when last at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>.</p>
<p>"He is certainly a good brother," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, as she walked towards one of the windows.</p>
<p><addName>Mrs.</addName> Reynolds anticipated <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s delight, when she should enter the room. "And this is always the way with him," she added. "Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her."</p>
<p>The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings; but <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.</p>
<p>In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested her---and she beheld a striking resemblance to <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. <addName>Mrs.</addName> Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's lifetime.</p>
<p>There was certainly at this moment, in <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by <addName>Mrs.</addName> Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.</p>
<p>When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.</p>
<p>As they walked across the hall towards the river, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.</p>
<p>They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.</p>
<p>She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his </p>
<p>inquiries as to the time of her having left <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>, and of her having stayed in <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName>, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.</p>
<p>At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.</p>
<p>The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived---that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly altered---what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners </p>
<p>so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to his last address in <placeName key="Rosings">Rosings Park</placeName> , when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account for it.</p>
<p>They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> House, whichever it might be, where <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> then was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind---in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.</p>
<p>At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.</p>
<p>They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> longed to explore its windings; </p>
<p>but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk here being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an </p>
<p>interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said no more.</p>
<p><persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself. "What will be his surprise," thought she, "when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of fashion."</p>
<p>The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. That he was surprised by the connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned his back with them, and entered into conversation with <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.</p>
<p>The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport. <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, who was walking arm-in-arm with <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, gave her a look expressive of wonder. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at <placeName key="Hunsford"><settlement type="town">Hunsford</settlement></placeName> could not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me."</p>
<p>After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> took her place by her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected---"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming </p>
<p>forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. "They will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you---<persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> and his sisters."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s name had been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, his mind was not very differently engaged.</p>
<p>"There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at <placeName key="Lambton"><settlement type="county">Lambton</settlement></placeName> ?"</p>
<p>The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that whatever desire <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.</p>
<p>They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, <addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> were half a quarter of a mile behind.</p>
<p>He then asked her to walk into the house---but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly---and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn our before the tete-a-tete was over. On <addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>'s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> saw him walking slowly towards the house.</p>
<p>The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected. "He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.</p>
<p>"There is something a little stately in him, to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I have seen nothing of it."</p>
<p>"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was very trifling."</p>
<p>"To be sure, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>; or, rather, he has not <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s countenance, for his features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?"</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.</p>
<p>"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied her uncle. "Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but said nothing.</p>
<p>"From what we have seen of him," continued <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, "I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>. He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s so amiable, as they had been considered in <placeName key="Hertfordshire"><district type="county">Hertfordshire</district></placeName>. In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as such as might be relied on.</p>
<p><persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.</p>
<p>The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" n="44">
<p>Chapter 44</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>had settled it that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their arrival at <placeName key="Lambton"><settlement type="county">Lambton</settlement></placeName> , these visitors came. They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever </p>
<p>suggested it before, but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the parmedtiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.</p>
<p>She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.</p>
<p><persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place. With astonishment did <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her being at <placeName key="Lambton"><settlement type="county">Lambton</settlement></placeName> , she had heard that <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.</p>
<p><persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was tall, and on a larger scale than <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.</p>
<p>They had not long been together before <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> told her that<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have</p>
<p>stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.</p>
<p>To <addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just arisen of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was ready, <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><forename>Georgiana</forename></persName>was eager, and <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> determined, to be pleased.</p>
<p>In seeing<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, who had been set up as a rival to<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>. No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real</p>
<p>regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all her sisters were at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>. There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.</p>
<p>It was not often that she could turn her eyes on <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace---when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in <placeName key="Hunsford"><settlement type="town">Hunsford</settlement></placeName> Parsonage---the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company of his dear friends at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>, or his dignified relations at <placeName key="Rosings">Rosings</placeName>, had she seen him so desirous to please, </p>
<p>so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> and <placeName key="Rosings">Rosings</placeName>.</p>
<p>Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose to depart, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing <addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>, before they left the country. <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had turned away her head. Presuming however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.</p>
<p>Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their <placeName key="Hertfordshire"><district type="county">Hertfordshire</district></placeName> friends. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, and then hurried away to dress.</p>
<p>But she had no reason to fear <addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>'s curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was much better acquainted with <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.</p>
<p>Of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in <placeName key="Hertfordshire"><district type="county">Hertfordshire</district></placeName> to which he was known would not have recognized it for <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>. There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their <placeName key="Lambton"><settlement type="county">Lambton</settlement></placeName>  friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much </p>
<p>good among the poor.</p>
<p>With respect to <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName>, he had left many debts behind him, which <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> afterwards discharged.</p>
<p>As for <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, her thoughts were at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to </p>
<p>forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were</p>
<p>concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude---for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.</p>
<p>It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that such a striking civility as <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> the following morning. They were, therefore, to go. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was pleased; though when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.</p>
<p><persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> before noon.</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" n="45">

<p>Convinced as <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> now was that <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.</p>
<p>On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.</p>
<p>In this house they were received by <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, who was sitting there with <persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> and <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, and the lady with whom she lived in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.</p>
<p>By <persName key="LouisaHurst"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hurst</surname></persName> and <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> they were noticed only by a curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by <addName>Mrs.</addName> Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between her and <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, with occasional help from <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, the conversation was carried on. <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>soon saw that she was herself closely watched by <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, and that she could not speak a word, especially to <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, without calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s voice, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the others said no more.</p>
<p>The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from <addName>Mrs.</addName> Annesley to <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> had been given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole party---for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.</p>
<p>While thus engaged, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.</p>
<p>He had been some time with <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><forename>Georgiana</forename></persName>that morning. No sooner did he appear than <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> were by no means over. <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted,</p>
<p> and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:</p>
<p>"Pray, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName>Miss</addName><forename>Eliza</forename></persName>, are not the ----shire Militia removed from <placeName key="Meryton"><settlement type="town">Meryton</settlement></placeName>? They must be a great loss to your family."</p>
<p>In Darcy's presence she dared not mention <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s name; but <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached </p>
<p>her of <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; and from all<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should effect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><forename>Georgiana</forename></persName>also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.</p>
<p>Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was attending them to their carriage <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was venting her feelings in criticisms on <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s person, behaviour, and dress. But <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><forename>Georgiana</forename></persName>would not join her. Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such terms of <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> as to leave <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><forename>Georgiana</forename></persName>without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> returned to the saloon, <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.</p>
<p>"How very ill <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName>Miss</addName><forename>Eliza</forename><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> looks this morning, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>," she cried; "I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse!<persName key="LouisaHurst"><forename>Louisa</forename></persName> and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again."</p>
<p>However little <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.</p>
<p>"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character---there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable."</p>
<p>Persuaded as <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> admired <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued:</p>
<p>"I remember, when we first knew her in <placeName key="Hertfordshire"><district type="county">Hertfordshire</district></placeName>, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>, '_She_ a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time."</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but that was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."</p>
<p>He then went away, and <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname> </persName> was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.</p>
<p><persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit---of everything but himself; yet <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was longing to know what <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> thought of him, and <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" n="46">
<head>Chapter 46</head>
<p> <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> on their first arrival at <placeName key="Lambton"><settlement type="county">Lambton</settlement></placeName> ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was not surprised at it, as <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> had written the direction remarkably ill.</p>
<p>They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:</p>
<p>"Since writing the above, dearest <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you---be assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName>, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>! Imagine our surprise. To <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off </p>
<p>Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, they must have passed within ten miles of us. <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> gives us reason to expect him here soon. <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written."</p>
<p>Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> on finishing this letter instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.</p>
<p>"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> and our poor <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland. <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> came yesterday, having left <placeName key="Brighton"><settlement type="town">Brighton</settlement></placeName> the day before, not many hours after the express. Though <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s short letter to <addName>Mrs.</addName> F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to<placeName key="London"><district type="city">Clapham</district></placeName>, but no further; for on entering that </p>
<p>place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from <placeName key="Epsom"><settlement type="city">Epsom</settlement></placeName>. All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> road. I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>, Colonel F. came on into <placeName key="Hertfordshire"><district type="county">Hertfordshire</district></placeName>, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success---no</p>
<p>such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and <addName>Mrs.</addName> F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he fear W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. </p>
<p>Poor <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> with <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> is obliged to be at <placeName key="Brighton"><settlement type="town">Brighton</settlement></placeName> again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my uncle's advice and </p>
<p>assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness."</p>
<p>"Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant, and <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose."</p>
<p>"Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after <addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.</p>
<p>On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, "Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill."</p>
<p>"No, I thank you," she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. "There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>."</p>
<p>She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spoke again. "I have just had a letter from<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger sister has left all her friends---has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of---of <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>. They are gone off together from <placeName key="Brighton"><settlement type="town">Brighton</settlement></placeName>. You know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to---she is lost for ever."</p>
<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was fixed in astonishment. "When I consider," she added in a yet more agitated voice, "that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only---some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all---all too late now."</p>
<p>"I am grieved indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved---shocked. But is it certain---absolutely certain?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes! They left <placeName key="Brighton"><settlement type="town">Brighton</settlement></placeName> together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland."</p>
<p>"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"</p>
<p>"My father is gone to <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>, and <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But nothing can be done---I know very well that nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!" </p>
<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> shook his head in silent acquiescence.</p>
<p>"When my eyes were opened to his real character---Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not---I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!"</p>
<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air gloomy. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.</p>
<p>But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>---the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> to-day."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>. Say that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long."</p>
<p>He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away.</p>
<p>As he quitted the room, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName>; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.</p>
<p>If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if otherwise---if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s second letter, had she entertained a hope of <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s meaning to marry her. No one but<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. </p>
<p>While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise---all astonishment that <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.</p>
<p>She had never perceived, while the regiment was in <placeName key="Hertfordshire"><district type="county">Hertfordshire</district></placeName>, that <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl---oh! how acutely did she now feel it!</p>
<p>She was wild to be at home---to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to share with <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. <addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy, though <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> had never been a favourite with them, <addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> could not but be deeply afflicted. Not <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> promised every assistance in his power. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, though </p>
<p>expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. "But what is to be done about <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>?" cried <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>. "John told us <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was here when you sent for us; was it so?"</p>
<p>"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement. That is all settled."</p>
<p>"What is all settled?" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare. "And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!"</p>
<p>But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at <placeName key="Lambton"><settlement type="county">Lambton</settlement></placeName> , with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>.</p>

<div type="chapter" n="47">
<head>Chapter 47</head>
<p>"I have been thinking it over again, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName>? His temptation is not adequate to the risk!"</p>
<p>"Do you really think so?" cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, brightening up for a moment.</p>
<p>"Upon my word," said <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, "I begin to be of your uncle's opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>. Can you yourself, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?"</p>
<p>"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case?"</p>
<p>"In the first place," replied <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland."</p>
<p>"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road."</p>
<p>"Well, then---supposing them to be in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>. They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> than in Scotland."</p>
<p>"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no---this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>---what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as </p>
<p>any father could do, in such a matter."</p>
<p>"But can you think that <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?"</p>
<p>"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a twelvemonth---she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since the ----shire were first quartered in <placeName key="Meryton"><settlement type="town">Meryton</settlement></placeName>, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater---what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman."</p>
<p>"But you see that<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>," said her aunt, "does not think so very ill of <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> as to believe him capable of the attempt."</p>
<p>"Of whom does <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> knows, as well as I do, what <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating."</p>
<p>"And do you really know all this?" cried <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.</p>
<p>"I do indeed," replied <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, colouring. "I told you, the other day, of his infamous behaviour to <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>; and you yourself, when last at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty---which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> family are endless. From what he said of <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her."</p>
<p>"But does <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you and <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> seem so well to understand?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> and his relation Colonel <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><forename>Fitzwilliam</forename></persName> , I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire was to leave <placeName key="Meryton"><settlement type="town">Meryton</settlement></placeName> in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the case, neither<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> should go with <persName key="HarrietForster"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName>, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a consequence as this could ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my thoughts."</p>
<p>"When they all removed to <placeName key="Brighton"><settlement type="town">Brighton</settlement></placeName>, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?"</p>
<p>"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in or near <placeName key="Meryton"><settlement type="town">Meryton</settlement></placeName> was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites."</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.</p>
<p>They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night on the road, reached <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> by dinner time the next day. It was a comfort to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> to consider that <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> could not have been wearied by long expectations.</p>
<p>The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, who came running down from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives.</p>
<p>"Not yet," replied<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>. "But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope everything will be well."</p>
<p>"Is my father in town?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word."</p>
<p>"And have you heard from him often?"</p>
<p>"We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention."</p>
<p>"And my mother---how is she? How are you all?"</p>
<p>"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken. She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> and <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, thank Heaven, are quite well."</p>
<p>"But you---how are you?" cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>. "You look pale. How much you must have gone through!"</p>
<p>Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while <addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> were engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.</p>
<p>When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> or her father, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.</p>
<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes' conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous conduct of <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing.</p>
<p>"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point in going to <placeName key="Brighton"><settlement type="town">Brighton</settlement></placeName>, with all my family, this would not have happened; but poor dear <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And now here's <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> gone away, and I know he will fight <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do."</p>
<p>They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> the very next day, and would assist <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> in every endeavour for recovering <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>.</p>
<p>"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he; "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. It is not quite a week since they left <placeName key="Brighton"><settlement type="town">Brighton</settlement></placeName>. In a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done."</p>
<p>"Oh! my dear brother," replied <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, "that is exactly what I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, make them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they are married. And, above all, keep <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> from fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my wits---and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me---such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all."</p>
<p>But <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.</p>
<p>Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that one only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.</p>
<p>In the dining-room they were soon joined by <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> and <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>. As for <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName>, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:</p>
<p>"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation."</p>
<p>Then, perceiving in <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> no inclination of replying, she added, "Unhappy as the event must be for <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, we may draw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply. <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName>, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half-an-hour by themselves; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever."</p>
<p>"<persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey."</p>
<p>"And was Denny convinced that <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> seen Denny himself?"</p>
<p>"Yes; but, when questioned by him, Denny denied knowing anything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying---and from that, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."</p>
<p>"And till <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"</p>
<p>"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a little uneasy---a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s last letter she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks."</p>
<p>"But not before they went to <placeName key="Brighton"><settlement type="town">Brighton</settlement></placeName>?"</p>
<p>"No, I believe not."</p>
<p>"And did <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> appear to think well of <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> himself? Does he know his real character?"</p>
<p>"I must confess that he did not speak so well of <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> as he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left <placeName key="Meryton"><settlement type="town">Meryton</settlement></placeName> greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false."</p>
<p>"Oh,<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!"</p>
<p>"Perhaps it would have been better," replied her sister. "But to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions."</p>
<p>"Could <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> repeat the particulars of <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s note to his wife?"</p>
<p>"He brought it with him for us to see."</p>
<p><persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>. These were the contents:</p>
<p>"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign my name '<persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>.' What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my clothes when I get to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey.</p>
<p>"Your affectionate friend,</p>
<p>"<persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename><surname>BENNET</surname></persName>."</p>
<p>"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>!" cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> when she had finished it. "What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a scheme of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!"</p>
<p>"I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!"</p>
<p>"Oh!<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>," cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"</p>
<p>"I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties."</p>
<p>"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone."</p>
<p>"<persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> and <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them. <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> is slight and delicate; and <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And <persName key="LadyLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters', if they should be of use to us."</p>
<p>"She had better have stayed at home," cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; "perhaps she meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."</p>
<p>She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.</p>
<p>"He meant I believe," replied<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, "to go to <placeName key="Epsom"><settlement type="city">Epsom</settlement></placeName>, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from<placeName key="London"><district type="city">Clapham</district></placeName>. It had come with a fare from <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at<placeName key="London"><district type="city">Clapham</district></placeName>. If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this."</p>

<head>Chapter 48</head>
<p>The whole party were in hopes of a letter from <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him. His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion. They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of that they would have been glad to be certain. <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> had waited only for the letters before he set off.</p>
<p>When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> to return to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.</p>
<p><persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> and the children were to remain in <placeName key="Hertfordshire"><district type="county">Hertfordshire</district></placeName> a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up---though, as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.</p>
<p>All <placeName key="Meryton"><settlement type="town">Meryton</settlement></placeName> seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family. Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin more certain; and even<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.</p>
<p><persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> left <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street; that <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> had been to <placeName key="Epsom"><settlement type="city">Epsom</settlement></placeName> and<placeName key="London"><district type="city">Clapham</district></placeName>, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>, before they procured lodgings. <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> and promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:</p>
<p>"I have written to <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName> could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any other person."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her</p>
<p>power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.</p>
<p>Every day at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.</p>
<p>But before they heard again from <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>; which, as <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as follows:</p>
<p>"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from <placeName key="Hertfordshire"><district type="county">Hertfordshire</district></placeName>. Be assured, my dear <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>, that <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune---or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName>  informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, I am </p>
<p>inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, but likewise by <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense.</p>
<p>« I am, dear <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>, etc., etc. »</p>
<p><persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> did not write again till he had received an answer from <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName>; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send. It was not known that <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount. <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at <placeName key="Brighton"><settlement type="town">Brighton</settlement></placeName>. He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> did not attempt to conceal </p>
<p>these particulars from the <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> family. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> heard them with horror. "A gamester!" she cried. "This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it."</p>
<p><persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.</p>
<p>"What, is he coming home, and without poor <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>?" she cried. "Sure he will not leave <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> before he has found them. Who is to fight <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, and make him marry her, if he comes away?"</p>
<p>As <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>, at the same time that <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>.</p>
<p><persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> went away in all the perplexity about <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> and her <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName> friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had received none since her return that could come from <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>.</p>
<p>The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from that, though <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.</p>
<p>When <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual</p>
<p>philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.</p>
<p>It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it."</p>
<p>"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>.</p>
<p>"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. It will pass away soon enough."</p>
<p>"Do you suppose them to be in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>?"</p>
<p>"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"</p>
<p>"And <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> used to want to go to <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>," added <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>.</p>
<p>"She is happy then," said her father drily; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration."</p>
<p>Then after a short silence he continued:</p>
<p>"<persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind."</p>
<p>They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea.</p>
<p>"This is a parade," he cried, "which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> runs away."</p>
<p>"I am not going to run away, papa," said <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> fretfully. "If I should ever go to <placeName key="Brighton"><settlement type="town">Brighton</settlement></placeName>, I would behave better than <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>."</p>
<p>"_You_ go to <placeName key="Brighton"><settlement type="town">Brighton</settlement></placeName>. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner."</p>
<p><persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.</p>
<p>"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them."</p>

<div type="chapter" n="49">
<head>Chapter 49</head>
<p>Two days after <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s return, as <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town."</p>
<p>"Dear madam," cried <persName key="MrsHill"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>? He has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter."</p>
<p>Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said: </p>
<p>"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse."</p>
<p>Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.</p>
<p>Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:</p>
<p>"Oh, papa, what news---what news? Have you heard from my uncle?"</p>
<p>"Yes I have had a letter from him by express."</p>
<p>"Well, and what news does it bring---good or bad?"</p>
<p>"What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket. "But perhaps you would like to read it."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>impatiently caught it from his hand. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> now came up.</p>
<p>"Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is about."</p>
<p>"Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.</p>
<p>"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered. I have seen them both---"</p>
<p>"Then it is as I always hoped," cried<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>; "they are married!"</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>read on:</p>
<p>"I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money, even when all his </p>
<p>debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,</p>
<p>"Is it possible?" cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, when she had finished. "Can it be possible that he will marry her?" </p>
<p>"<persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him," said her sister. "My dear father, I congratulate you."</p>
<p>"And have you answered the letter?" cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>.</p>
<p>"No; but it must be done soon."</p>
<p>Most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time before he wrote.</p>
<p>"Oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back and write immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a case."</p>
<p>"Let me write for you," said<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, "if you dislike the trouble yourself."</p>
<p>"I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."</p>
<p>And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.</p>
<p>"And may I ask---" said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; "but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with."</p>
<p>"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little."</p>
<p>"And they must marry! Yet he is such a man!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him."</p>
<p>"Money! My uncle!" cried<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, "what do you mean, <roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName>?"</p>
<p>"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone."</p>
<p>"That is very true," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; "though it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this."</p>
<p>"No," said her father; "Wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."</p>
<p>"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?"</p>
<p><persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.</p>
<p>"And they are really to be married!" cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, as soon as they were by themselves. "How strange this is! And for this we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>!"</p>
<p>"I comfort myself with thinking," replied<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, "that he certainly would not marry <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?"</p>
<p>"If he were ever able to learn what <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s debts have been," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> has done for them, because <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> has not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!"</p>
<p>"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten."</p>
<p>"Their conduct has been such," replied <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "as neither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it."</p>
<p>It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly replied:</p>
<p>"Just as you please."</p>
<p>"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"</p>
<p>"Take whatever you like, and get away."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs together. <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> and <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> were both with <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>: one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> could hardly contain herself. As soon as <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> had read <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>'s hope of <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.</p>
<p>"My dear, dear <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>!" she cried. "This is delightful indeed! She will be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>! How merry we shall be together when we meet!"</p>
<p>Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>'s behaviour laid them all under.</p>
<p>"For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> with money."</p>
<p>"Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a daughter married.  <persName key="MrsWickham"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>! How well it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."</p>
<p>She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.</p>
<p>"I will go to <placeName key="Meryton"><settlement type="town">Meryton</settlement></placeName>," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on <persName key="LadyLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> and <persName key="MrsLong"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Long</surname></persName>. <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, run down and order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you in <placeName key="Meryton"><settlement type="town">Meryton</settlement></placeName>? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding."</p>
<p><persName key="MrsHill"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName> began instantly to express her joy. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.</p>
<p>Poor <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.</p>

<div type="chapter" n="50">
<head>Chapter 50</head>
<p><persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> had very often wished before this period of his life that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that respect, <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.</p>
<p>He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.</p>
<p>When first <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, for many years after <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.</p>
<p>Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> and the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with regard to <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, at least, which was now to be settled, and <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed that, could <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother's hands, <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s expenses had been </p>
<p>very little within that sum.</p>
<p>That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> to send any message to her.</p>
<p>The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had Miss <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in <placeName key="Meryton"><settlement type="town">Meryton</settlement></placeName> lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery was considered certain.</p>
<p>It was a fortnight since <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> had been downstairs; but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.</p>
<p>"Haye Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings could quit it---or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."</p>
<p>Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: "<persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>."</p>
<p>A long dispute followed this declaration; but <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was firm. It soon led to another; and <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> a fortnight before they took place.</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot.</p>
<p>She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much---not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> would connect himself with a family where, to every other objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.</p>
<p>From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName>, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet.</p>
<p>What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.</p>
<p>She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved; and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.</p>
<p>But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.</p>
<p>How <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p><persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> soon wrote again to his brother. To <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was to inform them that <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> had resolved on quitting the militia.</p>
<p>"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece's. It is <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s intention to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to <persName key="MrForster" ><roleName type="military">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName>, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> in and near <placeName key="Brighton"><settlement type="town">Brighton</settlement></placeName>, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in <placeName key="Meryton"><settlement type="town">Meryton</settlement></placeName>,</p>
<p> of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>; and I understand from <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and your mother.---Yours, etc.,</p>
<p><persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> and his daughters saw all the advantages of <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s removal from the ----shire as clearly as <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> could do. But <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was not so well pleased with it. <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in <placeName key="Hertfordshire"><district type="county">Hertfordshire</district></placeName>, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.</p>
<p>"She is so fond of <persName key="HarrietForster"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName>," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General----'s regiment."</p>
<p>His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative. But <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the North. When <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was surprised, however, that <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> should consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination, any </p>
<p>meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" n="51">
<head>Chapter 51</head>
<p>Their sister's wedding day arrived; and <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> felt for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> more especially, who gave <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> the feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.</p>
<p>They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them. Smiles decked the face of <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.</p>
<p><persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.</p>
<p>Their reception from <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> was <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.</p>
<p><persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man. She blushed, and <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.</p>
<p>There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, who happened to sit near <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt</p>
<p>very unable to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.</p>
<p>"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was."</p>
<p>Her father lifted up his eyes. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was distressed. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> looked expressively at <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, "Ah!<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman."</p>
<p>It was not to be supposed that time would give <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see <persName key="MrsPhillips"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called " <persName key="MrsWickham"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>" by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of being married, to <persName key="MrsHill"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName> and the two housemaids.</p>
<p>"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must all go to <placeName key="Brighton"><settlement type="town">Brighton</settlement></placeName>. That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."</p>
<p>"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, I don't at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?"</p>
<p>"Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all."</p>
<p>"I should like it beyond anything!" said her mother.</p>
<p>"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over."</p>
<p>"I thank you for my share of the favour," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; "but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."</p>
<p>Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> had received his commission before he left <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.</p>
<p>No one but <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.</p>
<p>Wickham's affection for <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> was just what <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had expected to find it; not equal to <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s for him. She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.</p>
<p><persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.</p>
<p>One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>:</p>
<p>"<persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe. You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"</p>
<p>"No really," replied <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; "I think there cannot be too little said on the subject."</p>
<p>"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat."</p>
<p>"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man <addName>Mr.</addName> Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> might have done as well."</p>
<p>"<persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>!" repeated <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, in utter amazement.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> say? It was to be such a secret!"</p>
<p>"If it was to be secret," said<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, "say not another word on the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further."</p>
<p>"Oh! certainly," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions."</p>
<p>"Thank you," said <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> would be angry."</p>
<p>On such encouragement to ask, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.</p>
<p>But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> had been at her sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.</p>
<p>"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it---unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance."</p>
<p>"Not that I shall, though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out."</p>
<p>Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> privately of what <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> had let fall; <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" n="52">
<head>Chapter 52</head>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.</p>
<p>"Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.</p>
<p>"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from you. Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am---and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.</p>
<p>"On the very day of my coming home from <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your's seems to have been. He came to tell <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> that he had found out where your sister and <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> repeatedly, <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> once. From what I can collect, he left <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName> only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, </p>
<p>and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he had another motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.</p>
<p>"There is a lady, it seems, a <addName>Mrs.</addName> Younge, who was some time ago governess to <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This <addName>Mrs.</addName> Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found. <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, and afterwards insisted on seeing <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>. His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to </p>
<p>quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>. She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, he easily learnt had never been his design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have </p>
<p>nothing to live on.</p>
<p>"<persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.</p>
<p>"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.</p>
<p>"Every thing being settled between them, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But <persName key="EdwardGardiner"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> could not be seen, and <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.</p>
<p>"On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.</p>
<p>"They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times, but this is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.</p>
<p>"They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due. But, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, this must go no farther than yourself, or <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> at most.</p>
<p>"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve, or anybody's reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair.</p>
<p>"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>; but it was agreed that he should be in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish.</p>
<p>"I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> came to us; and <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> had constant admission to the house. He was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in <placeName key="Hertfordshire"><district type="county">Hertfordshire</district></placeName>; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> and<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, and for their sakes had patience with her.</p>
<p>"<persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was punctual in his return, and as <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName>. His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently, his wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion.</p>
<p>"Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.</p>
<p>"But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half hour.</p>
<p>"Yours, very sincerely,</p>
<p>"M. GARDINER."</p>
<p>The contents of this letter threw <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he </p>
<p>had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her---for a woman who had already refused him---as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>. Brother-in-law of <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. </p>
<p>They owed the restoration of <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, her character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself. She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> and herself.</p>
<p>She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>.</p>
<p>"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he, as he joined her.</p>
<p>"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome."</p>
<p>"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and now we are better."</p>
<p>"True. Are the others coming out?"</p>
<p>"I do not know. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> are going in the carriage to <placeName key="Meryton"><settlement type="town">Meryton</settlement></placeName>. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>."</p>
<p>She replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p>"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my name to you."</p>
<p>"Yes, she did."</p>
<p>"And what did she say?"</p>
<p>"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had---not turned out well. At such a distance as that, you know, things are strangely misrepresented."</p>
<p>"Certainly," he replied, biting his lips. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:</p>
<p>"I was surprised to see <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> in town last month. We passed each other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there."</p>
<p>"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>. "It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year." </p>
<p>"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at <placeName key="Lambton"><settlement type="county">Lambton</settlement></placeName> ? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had."</p>
<p>"Yes; he introduced us to his sister."</p>
<p>"And do you like her?"</p>
<p>"Very much."</p>
<p>"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well."</p>
<p>"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."</p>
<p>"Did you go by the village of Kympton?"</p>
<p>"I do not recollect that we did."</p>
<p>"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect."</p>
<p>"How should you have liked making sermons?"</p>
<p>"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?"</p>
<p>"I have heard from authority, which I thought as good, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the</p>
<p>present patron."</p>
<p>"You have. Yes, there was something in that; I told you so from the first, you may remember."</p>
<p>"I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly."</p>
<p>"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."</p>
<p>They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:</p>
<p>"Come, <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind."</p>
<p>She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" n="53">
<head>Chapter 53</head>
<p><persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName> was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.</p>
<p>The day of his and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s departure soon came, and <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.</p>
<p>"Oh! my dear <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"</p>
<p>"Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps."</p>
<p>"Write to me very often, my dear."</p>
<p>"As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for writing. My sisters may write to me. They will have nothing else to do."</p>
<p><persName key="GeorgeWickham"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>'s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.</p>
<p>"He is as fine a fellow," said <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename><surname>Lucas</surname></persName> himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law."</p>
<p>The loss of her daughter made <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> very dull for several days.</p>
<p>"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them."</p>
<p>"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>. "It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single."</p>
<p>"It is no such thing. <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> does not leave me because she is married, but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."</p>
<p>But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was quite in the fidgets. She looked at<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, and smiled and shook her head by turns.</p>
<p>"Well, well, and so <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> is coming down, sister," (for <persName key="MrsPhillips"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> first brought her the news). "Well, so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>, if he likes it. And who knows what may happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"</p>
<p>"You may depend on it," replied the other, "for <addName>Mrs.</addName> Nicholls was in <placeName key="Meryton"><settlement type="town">Meryton</settlement></placeName> last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed."</p>
<p>Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:</p>
<p>"I saw you look at me to-day, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of myself, but I dread other people's remarks."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName>, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it.</p>
<p>"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I will leave him to himself."</p>
<p>In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.</p>
<p>The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.</p>
<p>"As soon as ever <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> comes, my dear," said <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, "you will wait on him of course."</p>
<p>"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."</p>
<p>His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>.</p>
<p>"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he. "If he wants our society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again."</p>
<p>"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have <persName key="MrsLong"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Long</surname></persName> and the Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him."</p>
<p>Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, in consequence of it, before they did. As the day of his arrival drew near:</p>
<p>"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> to her sister. "It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I</p>
<p>be, when his stay at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> is over!"</p>
<p>"I wish I could say anything to comfort you," replied <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; "but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much."</p>
<p><persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> arrived. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in <placeName key="Hertfordshire"><district type="county">Hertfordshire</district></placeName>, she saw him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride towards the house.</p>
<p>Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> resolutely kept her place at the table; but <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, to satisfy her mother, went to the window---she looked,--she saw <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> with him, and sat down again by her sister.</p>
<p>"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>; "who can it be?"</p>
<p>"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know."</p>
<p>"La!" replied <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before. <addName>Mr.</addName> what's-his-name. That tall, proud man."</p>
<p>"Good gracious! <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him."</p>
<p><persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> looked at <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> with surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting in <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName>, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, and her resolution to be civil to him only as <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s friend, without being heard by either of them. But <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>'s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least </p>
<p>as reasonable and just as what <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> felt for<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>. Her astonishment at his coming---at his coming to <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>, to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName>.</p>
<p>The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.</p>
<p>"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early enough for expectation."</p>
<p>She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had expected. On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in <placeName key="Hertfordshire"><district type="county">Hertfordshire</district></placeName>, than as she had seen him at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.</p>
<p>Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.</p>
<p>Darcy, after inquiring of her how <addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName>. There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised he eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.</p>
<p>"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she. "Yet why did he come?"</p>
<p>She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.</p>
<p>She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.</p>
<p>"It is a long time, <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, since you went away," said <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>.</p>
<p>He readily agreed to it.</p>
<p>"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. <persName key="LadyLucas">><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> is married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately,  <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><forename>George</forename><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, Esq. to Miss <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> Bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?"</p>
<p>Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> dared not lift up her eyes. How <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> looked, therefore, she could not tell.</p>
<p>"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," continued her mother, "but at the same time, <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he has some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves."</p>
<p>Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.</p>
<p>"When you have killed all your own birds, <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>," said her mother, "I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not make <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion.</p>
<p>"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!"</p>
<p>Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.</p>
<p>When the gentlemen rose to go away, <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> in a few days time.</p>
<p>"You are quite a visit in my debt, <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>," she added, "for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement."</p>
<p>Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.</p>
<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year.</p>

<p>Chapter 54</p>
<p>As soon as they were gone, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s behaviour astonished and vexed her.</p>
<p>"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?"</p>
<p>She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.</p>
<p>"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will think no more about him."</p>
<p>Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>.</p>
<p>"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance."</p>
<p>"Yes, very indifferent indeed," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, laughingly. "Oh,<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, take care."</p>
<p>"My dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?"</p>
<p>"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever."</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, in half an hour's visit, had revived.</p>
<p>On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the dining-room, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> eagerly watched to see whether<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He placed himself by her.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.</p>
<p>His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, that if left wholly to himself,<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was almost as far from her as the table could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s mind; and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was </p>
<p>neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.</p>
<p>She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.</p>
<p>"If he does not come to me, then," said she, "I shall give him up for ever."</p>
<p>The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:</p>
<p>"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them; do we?"</p>
<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!</p>
<p>"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"</p>
<p>She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:</p>
<p>"Is your sister at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> still?"</p>
<p>"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."</p>
<p>"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?"</p>
<p>"<addName>Mrs.</addName> Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks."</p>
<p>She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> again, he walked away.</p>
<p>When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies all rose, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.</p>
<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> had designed to keep the two <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.</p>
<p>"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn---and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases' last week; and even <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, I never saw you look in greater beauty. <persName key="MrsLong"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Long</surname></persName> said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? 'Ah! <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, we shall have her at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> at last.' She did indeed. I do think <persName key="MrsLong"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Long</surname></persName> is as good a creature as ever lived---and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."</p>
<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s behaviour to<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.</p>
<p>"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>. "The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we may often meet again."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>smiled.</p>
<p>"<persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man."</p>
<p>"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment."</p>
<p>"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"</p>
<p>"And how impossible in others!"</p>
<p>"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?"</p>
<p>"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante."</p>

<head>Chapter 55</head>
<p>A few days after this visit, <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> called again, and alone. His friend had left him that morning for <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>, but was to return home in ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.</p>
<p>"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky."</p>
<p>He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.</p>
<p>"Can you come to-morrow?"</p>
<p>Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.</p>
<p>He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed. In ran <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:</p>
<p>"My dear<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, make haste and hurry down. He is come---<persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>'s hair."</p>
<p>"We will be down as soon as we can," said<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>; "but I dare say <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."</p>
<p>"Oh! hang <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! Where is your sash, my dear?"</p>
<p>But when her mother was gone, <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.</p>
<p>The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening. After tea, <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> retired to the library, as was his custom, and <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> sat looking and winking at <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> and <persName key="CatherineBennet"><forename>Catherine</forename></persName> for a considerable time, without making any impression on them. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> would not observe her; and when at last <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?"</p>
<p>"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you." She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, "Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> instantly gave a look at <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that she would not give in to it. In a few minutes, <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> half-opened the door and called out:</p>
<p>"<persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, my dear, I want to speak with you."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was forced to go.</p>
<p>"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother, as soon as she was in the hall. "<persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.</p>
<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s schemes for this day were ineffectual.<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all</p>
<p>her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.</p>
<p>He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.</p>
<p>After this day, <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed between the sisters concerning<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>; but <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence.</p>
<p>Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen him.<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.</p>
<p>But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her sister and<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but her's she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was on the point of going away again, when<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.</p>
<p><persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> could have no reserves from <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.</p>
<p>"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?"</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>. But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said for the present.</p>
<p>"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried. "I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!"</p>
<p>She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.</p>
<p>"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"</p>
<p>In a few minutes she was joined by<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.</p>
<p>"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.</p>
<p>"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say."</p>
<p>He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> really believed</p>
<p>all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.</p>
<p>It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever. <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> of nothing else for half an hour; and when <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was.</p>
<p>Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter, and said:</p>
<p>"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman."</p>
<p><persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.</p>
<p>"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income."</p>
<p>"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me."</p>
<p>"Exceed their income! My dear <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>," cried his wife, "what are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh! my dear, dear<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, I am so happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into <placeName key="Hertfordshire"><district type="county">Hertfordshire</district></placeName> last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!"</p>
<p>Wickham, <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, were all forgotten. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was beyond competition her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her</p>
<p>younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.</p>
<p><persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> petitioned for the use of the library at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>; and <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.</p>
<p>Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept.</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> had no attention to bestow on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, he always attached himself to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was gone, <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> constantly sought the same means of relief.</p>
<p>"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible."</p>
<p>"I suspected as much," replied <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>. "But how did he account for it?"</p>
<p>"It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other."</p>
<p>"That is the most unforgiving speech," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "that I ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of <persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s pretended regard."</p>
<p>"Would you believe it, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!"</p>
<p>"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty."</p>
<p>This naturally introduced a panegyric from <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.</p>
<p>"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>. "Oh! <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such another man for you!"</p>
<p>"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> in time."</p>
<p>The situation of affairs in the <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> family could not be long a secret. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was privileged to whisper it to <persName key="MrsPhillips"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in <placeName key="Meryton"><settlement type="town">Meryton</settlement></placeName>.</p>
<p>The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" n="56">
<head>Chapter 56</head>
<p>One morning, about a week after<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s engagement with <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming,<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"> <roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename><nameLink>de</nameLink><surname>Bourgh</surname> </persName>.</p>
<p>They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> and <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, though she was perfectly unknown to</p>
<p>them, even inferior to what <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> felt.</p>
<p>She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.</p>
<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>,</p>
<p>"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your mother."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>replied very concisely that she was.</p>
<p>"And that I suppose is one of your sisters."</p>
<p>"Yes, madam," said <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, delighted to speak to a <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>. "She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family."</p>
<p>"You have a very small park here," returned <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> after a short silence.</p>
<p>"It is nothing in comparison of <placeName key="Rosings">Rosings</placeName>, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename><surname>Lucas</surname></persName>'s."</p>
<p>"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west."</p>
<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then added:</p>
<p>"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left <addName>Mr.</addName> and <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> well."</p>
<p>"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>now expected that she would produce a letter for her from <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.</p>
<p><persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>,</p>
<p>"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company."</p>
<p>"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and show her ladyship about the different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall, <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.</p>
<p>Her carriage remained at the door, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> saw that her waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.</p>
<p>"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in her face.</p>
<p>As soon as they entered the copse, <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> began in the following manner:--</p>
<p>"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>looked with unaffected astonishment.</p>
<p>"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here."</p>
<p>"Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so. My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that Miss <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>. Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you."</p>
<p>"If you believed it impossible to be true," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?"</p>
<p>"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."</p>
<p>"Your coming to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>, to see me and my family," said</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence."</p>
<p>"If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?"</p>
<p>"I never heard that it was."</p>
<p>"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?"</p>
<p>"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer."</p>
<p>"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"</p>
<p>"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."</p>
<p>"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You may have drawn him in."</p>
<p>"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."</p>
<p>"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."</p>
<p>"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit."</p>
<p>"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?"</p>
<p>"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me."</p>
<p><persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> hesitated for a moment, and then replied:</p>
<p>"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of his mother, as well as of her's. While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"</p>
<p>"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us."</p>
<p>"These are heavy misfortunes," replied <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>. "But the wife of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine."</p>
<p>"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."</p>
<p>"_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me."</p>
<p>"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient---though untitled---families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up."</p>
<p>"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal."</p>
<p>"True. You are a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition."</p>
<p>"Whatever my connections may be," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you."</p>
<p>"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"</p>
<p>Though <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> would not, for the mere purpose of obliging <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation:</p>
<p>"I am not."</p>
<p><persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> seemed pleased.</p>
<p>"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"</p>
<p>"I will make no promise of the kind."</p>
<p>"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require."</p>
<p>"And I certainly never shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject."</p>
<p>"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is such a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking? Are the shades of <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> to be thus polluted?"</p>
<p>"You can now have nothing further to say," she resentfully answered. "You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to the house."</p>
<p>And she rose as she spoke. <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> rose also, and they turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.</p>
<p>"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"</p>
<p>"<persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments."</p>
<p>"You are then resolved to have him?"</p>
<p>"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."</p>
<p>"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."</p>
<p>"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern---and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn."</p>
<p>"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point."</p>
<p>In this manner <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, "I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> would not come in again and rest herself.</p>
<p>"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."</p>
<p>"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through <placeName key="Meryton"><settlement type="town">Meryton</settlement></placeName>, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>?"</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.</p>

<head>Chapter 57</head>
<p>The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from <placeName key="Rosings">Rosings</placeName>, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, and her being the sister of<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>), had only set that down as almost certain and immediate,</p>
<p> which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time.</p>
<p>In revolving <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>'s expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.</p>
<p>If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> of coming again to <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> must give way.</p>
<p>"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all."</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s curiosity; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was spared from much teasing on the subject.</p>
<p>The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.</p>
<p>"<persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room."</p>
<p>She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might be from <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.</p>
<p>She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He then said,</p>
<p>"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest."</p>
<p>The colour now rushed into <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued:</p>
<p>"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even your sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>."</p>
<p>"From <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>! and what can he have to say?"</p>
<p>"Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: 'Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of <persName key="CharlotteCollins"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.'</p>
<p>"Can you possibly guess, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, who is meant by this?" 'This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.'</p>
<p>"Have you any idea, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:</p>
<p>"'My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine that his aunt, <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"> <roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename><nameLink>de</nameLink><surname>Bourgh</surname> </persName>, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.'</p>
<p>"_<persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>_, you see, is the man! Now, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, I think I have surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life! It is admirable!"</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.</p>
<p>"Are you not diverted?"</p>
<p>"Oh! yes. Pray read on."</p>
<p>"'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it become apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.' <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName> moreover adds, 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the </p>
<p>rector of <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>, I should very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.' That is his notion of Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> 's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be missish, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?"</p>
<p>"Oh!" cried <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "I am excessively diverted. But it is so strange!"</p>
<p>"Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, what said <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?"</p>
<p>To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.</p>

<head>Chapter 58</head>
<p>Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> half expected <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> to do, he was able to bring <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> with him to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> before many days had passed after <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>'s visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread,<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, who wanted to be alone with<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, proposed their all walking out. It was agreed to. <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> was not in the habit of walking; <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together.<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> and<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, and <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> was too much afraid of him to talk; <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.</p>
<p>They walked towards the Lucases, because <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> wished to call upon Maria; and as <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said:</p>
<p>"<persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's. I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."</p>
<p>"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> was so little to be trusted."</p>
<p>"You must not blame my aunt. <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them."</p>
<p>"If you will thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your family owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of you."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause, her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever."</p>
<p>Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.</p>
<p>They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>, and there relate her journey to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName>, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.</p>
<p>"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>, frankly and openly."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that. After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations."</p>
<p>"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence."</p>
<p>"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>. "The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility."</p>
<p>"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."</p>
<p>"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way."</p>
<p>"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me."</p>
<p>"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."</p>
<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> mentioned his letter. "Did it," said he, "did it soon make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?"</p>
<p>She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.</p>
<p>"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me."</p>
<p>"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies."</p>
<p>"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit."</p>
<p>"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure."</p>
<p>"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty;</p>
<p> and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."</p>
<p>"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"</p>
<p>"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses."</p>
<p>"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after that evening?"</p>
<p>"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction."</p>
<p>"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>. You blamed me for coming?"</p>
<p>"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."</p>
<p>"Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due."</p>
<p>"My object then," replied Darcy, "was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you."</p>
<p>He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName> in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.</p>
<p>She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.</p>
<p>After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.</p>
<p>"What could become of <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> and<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.</p>
<p>"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>.</p>
<p>"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."</p>
<p>"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much." And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.</p>
<p>"On the evening before my going to <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>," said he, "I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.</p>
<p>"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"</p>
<p>"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection."</p>
<p>"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him."</p>
<p>"It did.<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>longed to observe that <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.</p>

<div type="chapter" n="59">
<head>Chapter 59</head>
<p>"My dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> received from <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> as soon as she entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.</p>
<p>The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.</p>
<p>At night she opened her heart to<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>. Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.</p>
<p>"You are joking, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>. This cannot be!--engaged to <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible."</p>
<p>"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are engaged."</p>
<p><persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> looked at her doubtingly. "Oh, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him."</p>
<p>"You know nothing of the matter. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself."</p>
<p>Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.</p>
<p>"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," cried<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>. "My dear, dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, I would---I do congratulate you---but are you certain? forgive the question---are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?"</p>
<p>"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>? Shall you like to have such a brother?"</p>
<p>"Very, very much. Nothing could give either<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> or myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when I tell you all."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>. I am afraid you will be angry."</p>
<p>"My dearest sister, now be serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?"</p>
<p>"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>."</p>
<p>Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> by her solemn assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish.</p>
<p>"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s friend and your husband, there can be only<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> and yourself more dear to me. But <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> and <placeName key="Lambton"><settlement type="county">Lambton</settlement></placeName> ! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>"Good gracious!" cried <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> is not coming here again with our dear<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s way."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.</p>
<p>As soon as they entered,<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName> looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, "<persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName> may lose her way again to-day?"</p>
<p>"I advise <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, and <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>," said <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>, "to walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> has never seen the view."</p>
<p>"It may do very well for the others," replied <persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>; "but I am sure it will be too much for <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>. Won't it, <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>?" <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName> owned that she had rather stay at home. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> silently consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> followed her, saying:</p>
<p>"I am quite sorry, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience."</p>
<p>During their walk, it was resolved that <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s consent should be asked in the course of the evening. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> reserved to herself the application for her mother's. She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>In the evening, soon after <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> withdrew to the library, she saw <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means---that she, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him</p>
<p>with fears and regrets in disposing of her---was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>; and, while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants you in the library." She was gone directly.</p>
<p>Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. "<persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>," said he, "what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?"</p>
<p>How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>.</p>
<p>"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>. But will they make you happy?"</p>
<p>"Have you any other objection," said <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, "than your belief of my indifference?"</p>
<p>"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him."</p>
<p>"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms."</p>
<p>"<persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>," said her father, "I have given him my consent. He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he condescended to ask. I now give it to you, if you are resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your disposition, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>. I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about."</p>
<p>Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months' suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.</p>
<p>"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with you, my <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>, to anyone less worthy."</p>
<p>To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> had voluntarily done for <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>. He heard her with astonishment.</p>
<p>"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and would have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."</p>
<p>He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go---saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come for <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> or <persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.</p>
<p>When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.</p>
<p>"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>! Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s is nothing to it---nothing at all. I am so pleased---so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><addName type="nick">Lizzy</addName></persName>. A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted."</p>
<p>This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.</p>
<p>"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow."</p>
<p>This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> found that, though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.</p>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.</p>
<p>"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he. " <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>'s."</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" n="60">
<head>Chapter 60</head>
<p><persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. "How could you begin?" said she. "I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?"</p>
<p>"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun."</p>
<p>"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners---my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?"</p>
<p>"For the liveliness of your mind, I did."</p>
<p>"You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them. Had you not been really amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you. There---I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me---but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love."</p>
<p>"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> while she was ill at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName>?"</p>
<p>"Dearest<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?"</p>
<p>"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."</p>
<p>"But I was embarrassed."</p>
<p>"And so was I."</p>
<p>"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."</p>
<p>"A man who had felt less, might."</p>
<p>"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when you would have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> had certainly great effect. Too much, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This will never do."</p>
<p>"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName>'s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's. My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing."</p>
<p>"<persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> for? Was it merely to ride to <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?"</p>
<p>"My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made."</p>
<p>"Shall you ever have courage to announce to <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> what is to befall her?"</p>
<p>"I am more likely to want more time than courage, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>. But it ought to done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly."</p>
<p>"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you</p>
<p>and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."</p>
<p>From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> had been over-rated, <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had never yet</p>
<p>answered <persName key="MrsGardiner"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName>'s long letter; but now, having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:</p>
<p>"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed. But now suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than<persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName>; she only smiles, I laugh. <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me. You are all to come to <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> at Christmas. Yours, etc."</p>
<p><persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>'s letter to <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> was in a different style; and still different from either was what <persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> sent to <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, in reply to his last.</p>
<p>"I must trouble you once more for congratulations. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> will soon be the wife of <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName>. Console <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> as well as you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.</p>
<p>"Yours sincerely, etc."</p>
<p><persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard. <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.</p>
<p>The joy which <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.</p>
<p>Before any answer could arrive from <persName key="WilliamCollins"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, or any congratulations to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> from his wife, the <placeName key="Longbourn">Longbourn</placeName> family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. <persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that <persName key="CharlotteLucas"><forename>Charlotte</forename></persName> , really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even listen to <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename><surname>Lucas</surname></persName>, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till <persName key="WilliamLucas"><roleName type="nobility">Sir</roleName> <forename>William</forename></persName></p>
<p>was out of sight.</p>
<p><persName key="MrsPhillips"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>'s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his forbearance; and though <persName key="MrsPhillips"><addName>Mrs.</addName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she did speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant. <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>.</p>

<head>Chapter 61</head>
<p>Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName> got rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she afterwards visited <addName>Mrs.</addName><persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>, and talked of <addName>Mrs.</addName> Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.</p>
<p><persName key="MrBennet"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bennet</surname></persName> missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in going to <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>, especially when he was least expected.</p>
<p><persName key="CharlesBingley"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> and <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> remained at <placeName key="Netherfield"><settlement type="estate">Netherfield</settlement></placeName> only a twelvemonth. So near a vicinity to her mother and <placeName key="Meryton"><settlement type="town">Meryton</settlement></placeName> relations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her affectionate heart. The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName>, and <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> and <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.</p>
<p><persName key="CatherineBennet"><addName type="nick">Kitty</addName></persName>, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a temper as <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>; and, removed from the influence of <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>'s society she was of course carefully kept, and though  <persName key="MrsWickham"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.</p>
<p><persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by <persName key="MrsBennet"><addName>Mrs.</addName><surname>Bennet</surname></persName>'s being quite unable to sit alone. <persName key="MaryBennet"><forename>Mary</forename></persName> was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.</p>
<p>As for <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> and <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName>, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> received from <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect:</p>
<p>"MY DEAR LIZZY,</p>
<p>"I wish you joy. If you love <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> half as well as I do my dear <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure <persName key="GeorgeWickham"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><addName>Mr.</addName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> about it, if you had rather not.</p>
<p>"Yours, etc."</p>
<p>As it happened that <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName> had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either <persName key="JaneBennet"><forename>Jane</forename></persName> or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she </p>
<p>retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.</p>
<p>Though <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> could never receive him at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>, yet, for <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s sake, he assisted him further in his profession. <persName key="LydiaBennet"><forename>Lydia</forename></persName> was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in <placeName key="London"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even<persName key="CharlesBingley"><surname>Bingley</surname></persName>'s good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.</p>
<p><persName key="CarolineBingley"><addName>Miss</addName> <surname>Bingley</surname></persName> was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>.</p>
<p><placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName> was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what <persName key="FitzwilliamDarcy"><surname>Darcy</surname></persName> had hoped to see. They were able to love each other even as well as they intended. <persName key="GeorgianaDarcy"><forename>Georgiana</forename></persName>had the highest opinion in the world of <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.</p>
<p><persName key="CatherinedeBourgh"><roleName type="nobility">Lady</roleName> <forename>Catherine</forename></persName> was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>'s persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at <placeName key="Pemberley">Pemberley</placeName>, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.</p>
<p>With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy, as well as <persName key="ElizabethBennet"><forename>Elizabeth</forename></persName>, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into <placeName key="Derbyshire"><district type="county">Derbyshire</district></placeName>, had been the means of uniting them.</p>
